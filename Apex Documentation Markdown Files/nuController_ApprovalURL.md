### Description
This class is designed to facilitate the generation of a URL for the approval process in a Salesforce environment. It leverages a separate utility class `createApprovalUrl` to dynamically create a URL string based on provided record and recipient IDs. The class encapsulates properties for the record ID (`recID`) and recipient ID (`recipientID`) and provides a dynamic getter for the URL string (`urlStr`) that combines these two properties into a final URL for approval actions.

### Methods
There are no explicit methods defined within this class other than the getter for the `urlStr` property, which invokes:
```java
createApprovalUrl.generateApprovalURL(recId, recipientID);
```
This method call is internal to the getter of the `urlStr` property and is utilized to dynamically generate the approval URL based on the current state of the `recID` and `recipientID` properties.

### Properties
- **recID**: A string type property that holds the record ID for which the approval URL will be generated. It is accessible for both reading (get) and writing (set).
- **recipientID**: A string property designated to store the recipient ID, indicating the target user for the approval action. Like `recID`, it supports both getting and setting operations.
- **urlStr**: A read-only string property that dynamically generates and returns the approval URL by combining `recID` and `recipientID` through the `createApprovalUrl.generateApprovalURL()` method.

### Use Case
This class can be utilized in scenarios where an approval process requires a dynamic URL to be generated and sent to a specific recipient based on the context of a particular record. For instance, it can be used in an email service where automated emails need to include a direct approval URL for records that have been submitted for approval.

### Important Notes
- This class relies on an external utility class (`createApprovalUrl`) and its method `generateApprovalURL(String, String)` to function correctly. Ensure this utility class is present and accessible in your org.
- The `urlStr` property getter method calls an external method every time it is accessed, which may have performance implications depending on the complexity and execution time of the `generateApprovalURL` method.
- The properties `recID` and `recipientID` must be properly set before accessing the `urlStr` property to ensure the correct URL is generated. Unset or incorrectly set IDs may result in an invalid URL.
- Error handling is not explicitly mentioned, so it's advisable to consider potential exceptions or errors that might occur during the generation of the URL, especially around the external utility method call within the `urlStr` property.
