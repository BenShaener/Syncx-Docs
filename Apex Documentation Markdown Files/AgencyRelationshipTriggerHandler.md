**Description:**  
This class is designed to handle operations related to the insertion of `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records in Salesforce. Its primary functionality is to automate the creation of relationships between company agencies and their child accounts. Upon inserting new `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records, it queries for child accounts related to the companies in these records and generates new relationship records linking these child accounts with the respective agencies.

**Methods:**

- `handleInsert(List<Company_Agency_Relationship__c> newAgencies)`: Processes newly inserted `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records to automatically create relationships for child accounts of the companies associated with these records.
  
  **Parameters:**
  - `List<Company_Agency_Relationship__c> newAgencies`: A list of newly created `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records to be processed.

**Properties:**  
There are no explicit properties in this class, as it mainly operates on the input list of `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records and interacts with the `Account` object to retrieve child accounts.

**Use Case:**  
Imagine a scenario where your Salesforce org tracks relationships between companies and agencies, and you need to ensure any new relationship automatically includes the child accounts of the company in question. When a `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` record is inserted, representing a new relationship between a company and an agency, this handler will automatically find any child accounts of that company and create corresponding `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records for them, effectively ensuring that the relationship is represented at all levels of the company's structure.

**Important Notes:**  
- The method `handleInsert` checks for any child accounts of the companies involved in the new relationships and does not handle updates or deletions. Therefore, it's designed to work specifically with insertion operations.
- The class assumes that the `Company__c` field on the `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` object holds the `Id` of a `Company` record, which in turn can have child `Accounts`.
- The approach utilized involves bulkifying the SOQL queries and DML operations to comply with Salesforce governor limits, which is a required practice for efficient trigger handling.
- This handler does not include error handling. In production-ready code, consider implementing try-catch blocks or other error-handling mechanisms to manage exceptions gracefully.
