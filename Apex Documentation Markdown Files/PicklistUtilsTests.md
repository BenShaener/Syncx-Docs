### Description
This class primarily focuses on testing the `PicklistUtils` class functionalities. It ensures that methods for retrieving picklist values based on various criteria such as object type, field name, and record type are functioning as expected. It also covers cases where errors are expected, like passing invalid object names or field names. Additionally, the class includes tests for getting case status values based on their open/closed status and incorporates a mock HTTP response for testing HTTP callouts.

### Methods

- `getPicklistValues_works_with_object_reference()`: Tests retrieving picklist values by passing `SObjectType` and field directly.
- `getPicklistValues_works_with_strings()`: Tests retrieving picklist values using string representations of the object and field names.
- `getPicklistValues_fails_when_invalid_objectName()`: Tests error handling for invalid object name inputs.
- `getPicklistValues_fails_when_invalid_fieldName()`: Tests error handling for invalid field name inputs.
- `getPicklistValuesWithRecordType_works()`: Tests retrieving picklist values for a specified record type using mock HTTP responses.
- `getPicklistValuesWithRecordType_fails_when_error_code()`: Tests the error handling of HTTP request failures using mock responses.
- `getCaseStatusValues_works_with_closed_cases()`: Tests retrieving case status values where cases are closed.
- `getCaseStatusValues_works_with_open_cases()`: Tests retrieving case status values for open cases.

### Properties
- `MockSimpleHttpResponse`: A mock HTTP response class used to simulate HTTP callouts within test methods.

### Use Case
This class is used to validate the functionality of the `PicklistUtils` utility class, particularly focusing on its ability to accurately retrieve picklist values under various conditions. It tests the robustness and error handling capabilities of the utility methods, ensuring that they correctly interpret input parameters and handle exceptional situations like invalid inputs or failed HTTP callouts.

### Important Notes
- The class uses `@isTest` annotation to denote that it contains test methods. This means it will not be included as part of the organization's Apex code limit.
- `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` are used to define test transaction boundaries, allowing callouts and asynchronous operations to complete.
- Exception handling is tested by expecting specific exceptions and validating the received error messages, confirming that the `PicklistUtils` class properly communicates issues encountered during execution.
- The use of `Test.setMock` with `HttpCalloutMock` demonstrates testing patterns for methods that perform HTTP callouts, by mocking expected responses without making actual external requests.
