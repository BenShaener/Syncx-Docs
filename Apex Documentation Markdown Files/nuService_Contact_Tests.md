### Description
This class is a collection of test methods designed to validate the functionality of retrieving contacts, accounts, and user dashboard preferences associated with a specific user in a Salesforce organization. It leverages asynchronous (`@future`) methods to perform callouts and test the related functionality within the `nuService_Contact` service class. 

### Methods
- `fetchContactIdFromUser_Test()`: Tests fetching a `ContactId` for a user.
- `futurefetchContactIdFromUser_Test()`: Asynchronous method to support `fetchContactIdFromUser_Test`.
- `fetchContactById_Test()`: Tests fetching a `Contact` record by `ContactId`.
- `futurefetchContactById_Test()`: Asynchronous method to support `fetchContactById_Test`.
- `getDashboardPreferencesTest()`: Tests retrieving user dashboard preferences.
- `futuregetDashboardPreferencesTest()`: Asynchronous method to support `getDashboardPreferencesTest`.
- `fetchContactFromUserTest()`: Tests fetching a `Contact` record for a user.
- `futurefetchContactFromUserTest()`: Asynchronous method to support `fetchContactFromUserTest`.
- `fetchAccountByContactIdTest()`: Tests fetching an `Account` record by `ContactId`.
- `futurefetchAccountByContactIdTest()`: Asynchronous method to support `fetchAccountByContactIdTest`.

### Properties
No explicit properties are defined in this class outside of method-specific variables.

### Use Case
This class is specifically used to validate that the `nuService_Contact` class correctly interacts with Salesforce to retrieve contact and account information based on users and their roles within an organization. It also checks for proper retrieval of dashboard preferences, ensuring the service class handles these operations correctly.

### Important Notes
- These tests depend on the `nuMockFactory` to create test user data, including portal users.
- The tests involve @future methods with callout=true, hinting at integration or external API calls.
- Custom settings (`NUCSH__c`) are inserted at the beginning of each test method to initialize certain parameters or configurations required by the logic being tested.
- Proper test data isolation is ensured via `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()`, which also allow for testing of @future methods.
- The use of `System.runAs(usr)` indicates testing across different user contexts to ensure functionality behaves correctly under different permissions or user roles.
- Exceptions within tests are caught and asserted to fail the test explicitly with a descriptive message, aiding in diagnosing issues during test execution.
