### Description

This Apex class provides functionality to send scheduled availability emails to relevant contacts based on the events passed to it. It organizes events by their placement, determines the time frame for each placement's events, and customizes the email content based on the earliest start date and the latest end date for the events within a placement. Contacts are then identified based on their association with the event characteristics and sent an email notification about the available scheduled events.

### Methods

- `sendAvailabilityScheduledEventEmail(List<Scheduled_Event__c> eventList)`: This is a static method designed to process a list of `Scheduled_Event__c` objects. For each unique placement associated with the provided events, it sends an email to contacts associated with that placement, informing them of the available shifts within a given time frame.

### Properties

The class itself does not explicitly declare properties, but it operates on properties of the `Scheduled_Event__c` object, such as `Placement__c`, `Start_Date__c`, `End_Date__c`, `Specialty__c`, `Provider_Type__c`, and `What__c`.

### Use Case

This class is best used when there is a need to inform contacts about available scheduled events or shifts in a systematic and filtered manner. It can be triggered after new events have been scheduled or existing events have been updated, ensuring that relevant parties are always informed about opportunities or changes in schedules.

### Important Notes

- The method queries for an `EmailTemplate` and an `OrgWideEmailAddress` using specific criteria. Ensure the `EmailTemplate` with the `DeveloperName` 'Syncx_Available_Shifts' and the `OrgWideEmailAddress` with the `DisplayName` 'Syncx' exist in the organization.
- The email content is customized with the earliest start date and the latest end date of the events related to each placement. This requires that the email template has placeholders for these dates.
- The method queries contacts based on their association with the event's specialty, provider type, and a related account (`What__c`). Ensure this logic matches the organization's data model and desired target audience for these emails.
- The method performs DML operations (updating `Scheduled_Event__c` records and sending emails). Consider bulk operation limits and the potential need for handling partial successes in large-scale deployments.
- It uses Salesforce's single email messaging service, which has daily limits. Consideration should be given to the volume of emails sent and the organization's email limit.
