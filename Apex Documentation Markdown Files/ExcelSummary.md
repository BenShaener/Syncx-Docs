**Description**:  
This class named `ExcelSummary` is designed to encapsulate information about a particular "practice" such as details about the provider and financial attributes. It implements the `Comparable` interface, enabling instances of this class to be sorted based on defined criteria.

**Methods**:

- `compareTo(Object other)`: This method implements the `Comparable` interface's `compareTo` method, enabling comparison between two `ExcelSummary` objects, primarily based on `Practice_Name`, and secondarily on `Provider_Last_Name` if the `Practice_Name` is identical.
```java
public Integer compareTo(Object other)
```

**Properties**:
- `String Practice_Name`: Indicates the name of the practice. It's accessible and modifiable.
- `String Provider_Last_Name`: Represents the last name of the provider. It's accessible and modifiable.
- `String Provider_First_Name`: Represents the first name of the provider. It's accessible and modifiable.
- `String Type`: A general categorization of the summary, accessible and modifiable.
- `Decimal Total`: A numeric total, likely financial, related to the summary. Accessible and modifiable.
- `Decimal Fee`: Represents a fee amount associated with the summary. Accessible and modifiable.

**Use Case**:
An object of `ExcelSummary` could be used in a context where financial summaries of different medical or professional practices are being managed or processed. For example, generating a sorted list of practices based on their names for reporting purposes or when organizing billing and fee summaries to ensure accurate calculations and data presentation.

**Important Notes**:

1. `Comparable` Implementation: The `compareTo` method customizes how `ExcelSummary` objects are compared and sorted, which is essential for collections of `ExcelSummary` objects that require sorting.
2. Data Encapsulation: The properties used in this class encapsulate specific details about a practice, keeping the design modular and the data manageable.
3. Sorting Criteria: When sorting `ExcelSummary` objects, the primary sorting criterion is `Practice_Name`, and if those are identical, `Provider_Last_Name` is used.
