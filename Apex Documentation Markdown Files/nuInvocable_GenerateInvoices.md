### Description
This class provides functionality to initiate a batch job that generates invoices. It is designed to be invoked via Salesforce's process automation tools, such as Process Builder or Flow, using an invocable method. The invocable method allows it to be easily integrated into automated processes without requiring direct Apex coding.

### Methods
- **runGenerateInvoicesBatch(List<Date> weekEnds):** This invocable method triggers a batch job to generate invoices. It accepts a list of `Date` objects but uses only the first date in the list as the effective date for generating invoices. The method initiates the batch job with a specified batch size of 200 records per batch.

  Example:
  ```java
  @InvocableMethod(label = 'Run generate invoices job')
  public static void runGenerateInvoicesBatch(List<Date> weekEnds) {
      Date weekEnd = weekEnds[0];
      Database.executeBatch(new nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices(weekEnd), 200);
  }
  ```

### Properties
There are no properties explicitly defined within this class. All operations are carried out through its static method.

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful in scenarios where businesses need to automate invoice generation at the end of a specific period, such as a week, month, or custom billing cycle. By incorporating this class into a Salesforce automation (e.g., triggered by a record update or at a scheduled time), the process of generating invoices can be significantly streamlined, reducing manual effort and the potential for errors.

- Example Use Case in a Salesforce Process Builder:
  1. A process is defined to trigger at the end of each week.
  2. The process calls `runGenerateInvoicesBatch`, passing the end date of the current week.
  3. Invoices are automatically generated for transactions or services rendered during that week.

### Important Notes
- The method assumes that the list of dates (`weekEnds`) provided will contain at least one date. It does not handle scenarios where an empty list is passed.
- The actual logic for generating invoices is not contained within this class but in the `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices` batch Apex class, which needs to be defined elsewhere.
- The method uses a hardcoded batch size of 200 for processing the invoices. Adjustments to the batch size may be necessary based on the specifics of the invoice generation logic and the data volume to ensure optimal performance and avoid hitting governor limits.
