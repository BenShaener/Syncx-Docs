**Description**:

This Apex class is designed to encapsulate detailed information regarding placements, typically used in Human Resources or staffing applications. It serves as a container for data related to a job placement, including identifiers, names, statuses, and metrics related to job performance, compliance, and enrollment. The class is equipped to handle a variety of data types, from basic information about the job and employee to more complex lists detailing timesheets, compliance credentials, and enrollments.

**Methods**:

No explicit methods are defined in this class, other than getters and setters provided by the `@AuraEnabled` annotation, which makes the properties accessible for Lightning Aura and Lightning Web Components.

**Properties**:

- `placementId`: Unique identifier for the placement.
- `name`: Name of the placement.
- `status`: Current status of the placement.
- `jobOrderId`: Identifier for the job order associated with the placement.
- `hiringAuditId`: Identifier for the hiring audit.
- `clientId`, `clientName`: Identifiers and name of the client.
- `agencyId`, `agencyName`: Identifiers and name of the agency managing the placement.
- `employeeId`, `employeeName`, `employeeCredential`: Employee details.
- `compliancePercentComplete`: Percentage of compliance tasks completed.
- `enrollmentPercentComplete`: Percentage of enrollment tasks completed.
- Metrics on hours worked (`totalHours`, `totalWorkedHours`, `totalRegularHours`, `totalOvertimeHours`, `totalDoubleTimeHours`, `totalPTOHours`, `totalHolidayHours`, `totalSickHours`).
- `customProperties`: Custom properties associated with the placement.
- `timesheets`: List of timesheets associated with the placement.
- `complianceCredentials`: List of compliance credentials.
- `enrollments`: List of enrollments.
- `mostRecentShiftStartDate`: The start date of the most recent shift.
- `specialty`: Specialty associated with the placement.

**Use Case**:

This class can be used in a Salesforce environment to manage and track the progress of job placements. It can serve as a data model for Lightning components that need to display or edit placement-related information, such as dashboards, detailed views, or reports. Its structured and comprehensive data fields make it suitable for HR applications, staffing agencies, or any organization that manages job placements and needs to track compliance, enrollment, and working hours.

**Important Notes**:

- The class is declared with `public without sharing`, indicating it does not enforce sharing rules. This choice should be carefully considered in the context of your application's security requirements.
- The `@AuraEnabled` annotation means that the properties can be accessed from Lightning Aura Components and Lightning Web Components, enabling a wide range of UI-based interactions with the placement data.
- The mixture of single data fields and lists suggests that this class could represent a significant load when instantiated with full datasets, which might impact performance depending on the usage context.
- There is a notable focus on compliance, enrollment, and detailed tracking of hours worked, indicating that this class is intended for use in environments where such metrics are crucial, such as healthcare staffing or consulting agencies.
- No explicit behavior (methods beyond property access) is defined within the class, indicating it serves purely as a data container. Business logic would need to be implemented elsewhere in the application architecture.
