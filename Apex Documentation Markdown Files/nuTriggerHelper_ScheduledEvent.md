### Description:

This class provides utility methods to handle scheduled events associated with `Scheduled_Event__c` Salesforce custom object. It includes functionalities such as sending emails for new shift availabilities, updating the dates of placements based on scheduled events, setting shifts to confirmed, checking workplace readiness slots, and updating rates for scheduled events. This class operates without sharing mode, indicating that it does not enforce record sharing rules.

### Methods:

- `sendNewShiftEmails(List<Scheduled_Event__c> newList)`: Sends email notifications for new shifts that are marked as available.

- `updatePlacementDates(List<Scheduled_Event__c> newList)`: Updates the start and end dates of placement records based on the dates of associated scheduled events marked as confirmed.

- `setConfirmedShift(List<Scheduled_Event__c> newList, Map<id, Scheduled_Event__c> oldMap)`: Marks shifts as confirmed in placement records and updates the latest confirmed shift information.

- `checkWRSlots(List<Scheduled_Event__c> newList, Map<id, Scheduled_Event__c> oldMap)`: Checks workplace readiness slots and associates them with confirmed scheduled events.

- `checkWRSlots(List<id> eventIds)`: This method is asynchronous (@future) and does the heavy lifting for workplace readiness slot checking by making callouts and updating records as needed.

- `updateRate(List<Scheduled_Event__c> newList)`: Updates the billing rate for scheduled events based on the placement's rate settings and calculates holidays.

### Properties:

- `private static Map<id,nuPlacement__c> parentPlacementMap`: Stores placement records associated with Scheduled Events to minimize SOQL queries by caching information.

### Use Case:

This class is tailored for scenarios where automation surrounding scheduled events is crucial. It can be used as part of a larger process in workforce management applications, particularly in scenarios such as scheduling healthcare workers, tracking their availability, confirming shifts, and ensuring current rates and workplace readiness.

### Important Notes:

- The class is defined as `without sharing`, meaning it executes with the full permissions of the system user, regardless of the operation's user. Caution should be exercised to prevent unintended data access or modification.
  
- The methods within this class must be explicitly called from triggers or other classes; they will not automatically run upon record creation or update.

- The `checkWRSlots(List<id> eventIds)` method is marked as `@future`, indicating it runs asynchronously and allows for callouts, necessary for potentially lengthy operations such as external API calls or time-consuming processing. Therefore, it's essential to account for governor limits and ensure that the method's calls are minimized and optimized.

- Pattern matching and date manipulation logic is used extensively to parse, validate, and compute dates for correct functionality. Special attention should be given to ensure data integrity and format consistency when interacting with these features, especially in global settings with different date formats.
