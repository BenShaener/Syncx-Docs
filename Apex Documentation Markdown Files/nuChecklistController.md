### Description
The `nuChecklistController` class is designed to dynamically generate checklists based on Salesforce records (Accounts or Contacts) and return a comprehensive list of tasks or items associated with the specific record. These checklists contain details about whether certain requirements are complete and provide URLs for easy navigation within the Salesforce UI.

### Methods
- **returnChecklist(Id recordId):** Accepts a Salesforce record ID as input and determines if the record is an Account or Contact. Based on the type, it delegates to either `returnAccountChecklist` or `returnContactChecklist` method and returns a serialized JSON representation of checklist details.

- **returnAccountChecklist(Id recordId):** Generates a checklist specific to an Account record. It checks for various related records such as Rate Tables, Compliance Requirements, Contacts, and Company Agency Relationships, and prepares a detailed list indicating which of these elements are present for the account.

- **returnContactChecklist(Id recordId):** Generates a checklist for a Contact record. It reviews dashboard preferences, associated provider types, specialties, and checks if the portal is enabled for the contact, providing a list with these details.

### Properties
Within the `checklistDetail` inner class:
- **name (String):** The name of the checklist item.
- **complete (Boolean):** Whether the checklist item is complete.
- **objectName (String):** The Salesforce object associated with the checklist item.
- **url (String):** The URL to access related records for the checklist item in the Salesforce UI.
- **values (List<String>):** A list of values related to the checklist item.

### Use Case
This controller is particularly useful in scenarios where a dynamic checklist needs to be generated for Salesforce records, such as during a record review process or when displaying record-specific tasks in a custom UI. The checklists can help users quickly understand what related records or tasks are associated with an Account or Contact and easily navigate to the relevant sections in Salesforce to view or complete these tasks.

### Important Notes  
- The `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)` annotation on `returnChecklist` method indicates that this method is accessible from a Lightning Web Component (LWC) or Aura Component and is cacheable by the client, improving performance for read-only data.
- The dynamic checklist generation is based on predefined logic for Accounts and Contacts. If additional Salesforce objects or checklist items are needed, the code must be extended accordingly.
- The URLs generated within the checklist are hardcoded paths to Lightning Experience UI. If your Salesforce org uses a different UI approach or custom pages, these URLs may need adjustment.
- Proper object and field-level security settings should be in place to ensure that users accessing the checklist have the necessary permissions to view the related objects and fields.
