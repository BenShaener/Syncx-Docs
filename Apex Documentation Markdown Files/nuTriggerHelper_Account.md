### Description
This Apex class provides a suite of utility methods to handle various operations related to `Account` objects in Salesforce, including:
- Notifications and email alerts for newly created accounts.
- Populating custom auto-number fields based on certain criteria.
- Updating related records (`nuPlacement__c` and `Company_Agency_Relationship__c`) based on changes in `Account` records.

### Methods

- `fetchAccountsForNotification(List<Account> newList, Map<Id, Account> oldMap)`: Sends custom notifications and emails to users for newly created accounts, distinguishing between agency and client accounts.

- `populateAccountAutoNumber(List<Account> newList, Map<Id, Account> oldMap)`: Populates a custom auto-number field on `Account` records based on predefined criteria and updates a custom setting for the next number in sequence.

- `updatePlacementsFromCompanyAccount(List<Account> newList)`: Intended to update `nuPlacement__c` records when the parent company account has changed, though the implementation is commented out.

- `populateFieldsFromParentAccount(List<Account> newList)`: Copies selected fields from parent accounts to child accounts of a specific record type.

- `createRelationships(List<Account> newList)`: For new accounts with a parent, replicates `Company_Agency_Relationship__c` records from the parent to the child account.

- `getParentAccountsMap(List<Account> newList)`: A helper method that generates a map of parent `Account` records keyed by their `Id`, used to efficiently access parent account information.

### Properties
- `notificationType`: Holds the `CustomNotificationType` record that matches the 'Sync_Notification' developer name.
- `AGENCY_ACC_RT`, `FLOAT_POOL_ACC_RT`, `COMPANY_ACC_RT`: Constants holding RecordTypeIds for different Account types.

### Use Case
This class can be used in triggers on the `Account` object to automate the process of sending notifications, populating custom fields, and maintaining data integrity and relationships based on the creation or update of `Account` records. This includes handling scenarios like new account integrations, ensuring accounts have unique identifiers, and maintaining hierarchical account information.

### Important Notes
- Execute DML operations in bulk where possible to avoid hitting governor limits, particularly when creating email messages or relationships.
- Custom notification sending is based on finding specific Org-Wide Email Address and Email Template by their names; ensure these exist in the org.
- Code for updating `nuPlacement__c` records is commented out and thus, not functional without uncommenting and potentially adapting the logic.
- The method involving auto-numbering leverages a custom setting (`NUCSH__c`) for storing and incrementing the auto number. Ensure this custom setting is properly configured in the org.
- Since this class accesses multiple related records and fields, it requires appropriate sharing and permissions settings to avoid access issues.
