**Description:**  
This class acts as a gateway for various timesheet and expense-related operations. It interacts with a `nuITimesheetRepository` for data retrieval and manipulation, including fetching timesheets and expenses for contacts and approvers, submitting and approving timesheets and expenses, as well as managing timesheet entries and slots.

**Methods:**  
- `fetchTimesheetsForContact(Id contactId, List<String> statusFilters, Date startDate, Date endDate)`: Fetches timesheets for a specific contact based on status filters and date range.
- `receiveObjectNameByRecordId(Id recordId, String soType)`: Retrieves the object name associated with a given record ID.
- `fetchExpensesForAgencyContact(Id contactId, List<String> statusFilters, Date startDate, Date endDate)`: Fetches expenses for an agency contact based on status filters and date range.
- Numerous other methods for fetching, saving, submitting, approving, and rejecting timesheets and expenses, each tailored to different roles and criteria (e.g., `fetchTimesheetsForApproverContact`, `saveTimeSlot`, `approveExpense`, `rejectTimesheet`, etc.).

**Properties:**  
No direct properties defined, as this is a utility class with static methods.

**Use Case:**  
Suppose a Salesforce implementation for a staffing or consulting firm needs to manage timesheet and expense data for its employees and contractors. This gateway class would act as a centralized point to handle all operations related to retrieving, submitting, and processing timesheets and expenses, thus ensuring consistency and reusability across the application.

**Important Notes:**  
- The actual data handling and logic are abstracted away into the repository layer (`nuITimesheetRepository`), accessed via `nuRepoFactory.getTimesheetRepository()`. This design allows for easier maintenance and potential swapping of the implementation.
- This class does not enforce sharing rules (`public without sharing`), meaning it runs in the system context and may access all data regardless of the user's permissions. This behavior is essential to understand for security implications, especially in a multi-user environment.
- Debug statements are used extensively for logging, which can aid in debugging but may lead to performance overhead or expose sensitive information in logs if not carefully managed.
- The class handles both timesheets and expenses, indicating a close relationship between these entities in the application's data model.
