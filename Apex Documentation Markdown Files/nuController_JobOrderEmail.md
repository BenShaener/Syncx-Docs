### Description
This class provides functionality to send emails related to Job Orders in Salesforce. It contains methods to send emails for both open and closed job orders based on the job's status and associated agencies. It leverages Salesforce's email service to construct and send these emails in batches.

### Methods

- `sendOpenJobOrderEmail(List<Job_Order__c> jobList)`: Sends emails to agencies associated with an open job order. This method reads the first `Job_Order__c` record from the provided list, checks the job order status, and based on the status, it either proceeds to notify the agencies about the open job order or calls `sendClosedJobOrderEmail` if the job is closed.

- `sendClosedJobOrderEmail(Job_Order__c job)`: Sends emails to agencies associated with a closed job order. This method operates on a single `Job_Order__c` object, identifies the agencies linked to the job order, and sends them a notification email about the job order closure.

### Properties
No explicit properties are defined in this class; however, it uses several Salesforce objects such as `Job_Order__c`, `Account`, `EmailTemplate`, and `OrgWideEmailAddress` to perform its operations.

### Use Case
Assuming you have a Salesforce org managing job orders and associated agencies, this class can be utilized to automate the email notifications to agencies whenever a job order status changes. You can set up triggers or process builders to call these methods whenever relevant changes occur to a `Job_Order__c` record.

### Important Notes

- The method `sendOpenJobOrderEmail` only processes the first `Job_Order__c` object in the provided list. If multiple job orders must be processed, considerations need to be made to iterate over all orders or call this method separately for each job order.

- Before sending emails, it filters contacts based on their associated specialties, which must match the job order's specialty. This ensures that agencies receive only relevant job notifications.

- Both methods utilize a batch process (`nuBatchEmail`) for sending emails, which helps manage Salesforce's governor limits by breaking down the job into smaller chunks. The batch size is hardcoded to 50, which may need adjustment based on specific use cases or Salesforce org limits.

- There is an assumption that the `EmailTemplate` and `OrgWideEmailAddress` needed for sending the emails are correctly set up in Salesforce with the specified `DeveloperName` and `DisplayName`, respectively. Failure to have these records in place will result in runtime errors.

- This class does not handle exceptions explicitly. In a production environment, adding try-catch blocks and proper error handling is crucial to gracefully manage exceptions and ensure system stability.
