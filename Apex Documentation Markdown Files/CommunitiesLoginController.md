**Description:**
This class serves as a page controller specifically designed for managing the site login functionality within a Salesforce Community. By leveraging this controller, users can be redirected to the appropriate authentication page upon page load, contributing to a seamless login experience.

**Methods:**
- `forwardToAuthPage()`: This global method does not take any parameters. It retrieves the current page's URL parameters, specifically 'startURL' and 'display', to dynamically determine the redirect destination for authentication. It returns a `PageReference` object pointing to the authentication page. Here is an example of how this method looks:
  ```java
  global PageReference forwardToAuthPage() {
    String startUrl = System.currentPageReference().getParameters().get('startURL');
    String displayType = System.currentPageReference().getParameters().get('display');
    return Network.forwardToAuthPage(startUrl, displayType);
  }
  ```

**Properties:**
This class does not explicitly declare any properties. It mainly focuses on the redirection mechanism leveraging URL parameters from the current page context.

**Use Case:**
The primary use case for this controller is within a Salesforce Community where it's necessary to control user navigation during the login process. For instance, when a user accesses a specific URL within the community and needs to be authenticated, this controller can ensure that the user is redirected to the correct authentication page, possibly with a customized appearance depending on the 'display' URL parameter. This ensures that community users experience a seamless and intuitive login process.

**Important Notes:**
- The class is declared as `global with sharing`, which means it respects user data access and sharing rules, but can be accessed globally, allowing for use across various Salesforce instances and by external applications if necessary.
- Since this class deals with page redirection, it's crucial to carefully manage the parameters ('startURL' and 'display') to prevent open redirection vulnerabilities. Always validate and sanitize the URL parameters if they are being used for redirection to avoid security risks.
- The `Network.forwardToAuthPage` method is used for redirection, which is Salesforce's built-in way to handle authentication page navigation, ensuring compatibility and security within the Salesforce environment.
