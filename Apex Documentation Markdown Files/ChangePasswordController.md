### Description
This Apex class serves as a page controller specifically designed for handling operations related to changing a user's password on a Salesforce site. It provides functionalities for users to input their old password, a new password, and a verification input for the new password. Additionally, it contains a method to trigger the password change process and a static method for an unrelated incremental operation.

### Methods

1. **changePassword**

   - Signature: `public PageReference changePassword()`
   - Description: Invokes the `Site.changePassword` method with the provided `newPassword`, `verifyNewPassword`, and `oldPassword` inputs, returning a `PageReference` object that denotes the outcome or next page after attempting to change the password.

2. **justIncrement**

   - Signature: `public static void justIncrement()`
   - Description: This method demonstrates a basic operation of incrementing an integer variable a large number of times. It does not return any value or directly contribute to the primary purpose of the class.

### Properties

1. **oldPassword**: String variable to hold the user's current password input.
2. **newPassword**: String variable to receive the new password from the user.
3. **verifyNewPassword**: String variable used to verify the new password input by the user matches the `newPassword` field.

```java
public String oldPassword {get; set;}
public String newPassword {get; set;}
public String verifyNewPassword {get; set;}
```

### Use Case
This class is typically used on a visual interface where a user wishes to change their password. The user would input their current password along with a new password (and a verification of this new password) into the designated fields. Upon submitting, the `changePassword` method would then attempt to update the password, leading the user to a new page depending on whether the operation was successful or not.

### Important Notes
- This class makes use of Salesforce's built-in `Site.changePassword` method to handle the actual password change logic, simplifying the process and ensuring compliance with Salesforce's security standards.
- The `justIncrement` method does not align with the primary purpose of the class and seems to serve as either test/demonstration code or is mistakenly included. It should likely be reviewed for relevancy or removal.
- The class assumes successful input verification (matching new passwords and correct old password) happens on the frontend; however, additional backend validation and error handling could be implemented to ensure robustness.
- Proper error handling should be considered for the `changePassword` process to gracefully handle any issues that arise during the password change attempt.
