**Description:**
This class is designed to assist with hiring audit processes in an organization, particularly in tracking the progress and notification of various hiring stages, handling email alerts, and managing validations for name clearances. It facilitates the process by automatically fetching, processing, and notifying relevant stakeholders through predefined stages in the hiring audit process, leveraging Salesforce’s capabilities to manage data and communications efficiently.

**Methods:**

1. **fetchHiringAuditsForNotifications(List<Hiring_Audit__c> newList, Map<Id, Hiring_Audit__c> oldMap):** Fetches hiring audit records based on their statuses, prepares notifications, and sends out emails to the relevant contacts.

2. **processHiringAuditRecord(Hiring_Audit__c ha, List<Notification__c> notificationsToInsert, Map<Id, Map<String, List<Contact>>> agencyContactsByUserType, Map<Id, Map<String, List<Contact>>> clientContactsByUserType, List<Messaging.SingleEmailMessage> emails, Map<Id, Account> accountsMap):** Processes each hiring audit record, determines the recipients based on their roles, and prepares notification records and emails for sending.

3. **getBody(Hiring_Audit__c ha):** Generates the body text for notifications based on the hiring audit's status.

4. **buildEmailAlert(Hiring_Audit__c hiringAudit, Id contactId):** Prepares an email message based on the hiring audit's status, including setting the template and recipient.

5. **setNameClear(List<Hiring_Audit__c> newHA):** Helper method to set the name clearance for hiring audits based on specific logic.

**Properties:**

1. **HA_TILE_BASED_ON_STATUS_MAP:** Maps hiring audit statuses to their corresponding dashboard tiles.

2. **HA_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_BASED_ON_STATUS:** Maps hiring audit statuses to their associated email templates for notifications.

3. **HA_ALERT_BASED_ON_STATUS:** 3-level nested map defining alerting choices based on status, agency/company type, and user role.

4. **templateNameToTemplateIdMap:** Holds the mapping of email template names to their Salesforce IDs after query retrieval.

5. **notificationType:** Stores the specific custom notification type used for sending out notifications.

6. **owa:** Represents the organization-wide email address used for sending emails.

7. **syncRecipients:** A set to hold recipients for synchronization notifications.

**Use Case:**
This class can be particularly useful in recruitment scenarios where keeping track of different hiring stages and ensuring timely communication with the relevant parties is crucial. It automates sending updates and alerts based on the changing statuses of hiring audits, reducing manual overhead and enhancing the recruitment process efficiency.

**Important Notes:**

- This class does not share its data with other classes (`without sharing`) to preserve data visibility according to the running user’s permissions.
- It’s advisable to ensure that the email templates and dashboard tiles referenced exist and are correctly named within Salesforce to avoid any null pointer exceptions.
- Notifications and Emails are built but not actually sent within this code (`Messaging.sendEmail(emails, false);` is commented out), indicating a testing or development phase or reliance on a separate method or trigger for the actual sending process.
- The `setNameClear` method is particularly important for scenarios requiring validation against name clearances, showcasing a complex yet efficient query and mapping logic to update records accordingly.
