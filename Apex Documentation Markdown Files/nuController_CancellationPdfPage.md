**Description:**
The `nuController_CancellationPdfPage` class is designed to serve the backend functionality for a Visualforce page that generates a PDF regarding cancelled shifts. It primarily focuses on fetching and displaying details related to a specific placement, including its associated shifts, details about the provider, the work location, agency details, and relevant contacts. Key information such as start and end dates, approval dates, and cancellation details of shifts are also managed.

**Methods:**

- `nuController_CancellationPdfPage()`: A constructor method that initializes the class properties based on the provided `placementId`. It retrieves information regarding the placement, its associated cancelled shifts, the provider, the work location, the agency, and the contacts involved.

**Properties:**

- `List<Scheduled_Event__c> shifts`: Holds a list of cancelled scheduled events (shifts) associated with the placement.
- `nuPlacement__c placement`: Contains details about the specific placement.
- `Contact provider`: Details of the provider associated with the placement.
- `Account workLocation`: Information regarding the work location of the placement.
- `Account agency`: Details about the agency managing the placement.
- `Contact agencyContact`: Contact details of the agency's recruiting contact.
- `Contact clientContact`: Information about the client's contact involved in the shifts.
- `Date startDate, endDate`: Represents the start and end dates of the report's date range.
- `Date dateClientApproved, dateAgencyApproved, dateCancelled`: Tracks the dates when the client approved, the agency approved, and the cancellation happened, respectively.
- `String url`: Stores a URL parameter, possibly for backend redirection or referencing.

**Use Case:**
This controller is particularly used for generating a PDF that provides comprehensive details about a placement's cancelled shifts for a given period. It can be useful for admins, recruitment agencies, and healthcare facilities to audit, review, or keep records of staffing cancellations within their operations.

**Important Notes:**

- The class retrieves placement and shift data dynamically using the `placementId` from the page URL parameters, making it versatile for different placements.
- Proper error handling is implemented to display warning messages through `ApexPages.messages` when either no placement is found or there are no cancelled shifts associated with the provided `placementId`.
- It assumes that related `Scheduled_Event__c`, `nuPlacement__c`, `Contact`, and `Account` objects are structured with specific custom fields as per the SOQL queries used within the class.
- The class is marked `with sharing` to respect Salesforce's record-level access rules, ensuring that users can only access data they are permitted to view according to their permissions and sharing settings.
