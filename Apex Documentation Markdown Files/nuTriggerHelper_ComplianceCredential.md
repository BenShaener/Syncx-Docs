### Description
This class provides functionality to handle and send notifications and emails for various stages of the `Compliance_Credential__c` object changes. These stages include new submissions, agency submissions, reviews, and approvals, each triggering specific notifications and emails to related contacts and account managers.

### Methods

- `fetchComplianceCredentialsForNotifications(List<Compliance_Credential__c> newList, Map<Id, Compliance_Credential__c> oldMap)`: Main method to handle the logic of fetching compliance credentials and preparing notifications and emails based on the old and new states of compliance credentials.

- `buildNotificationForCC(String title, String body, Id targetRecord, Id contactId, Boolean isAlert)`: Helper method to create a new `Notification__c` object.

- `buildEmailForCC(String subject, String body, String target)`: Helper method to create a new `Messaging.SingleEmailMessage` object prepared with given subject, body, and target information.

### Properties

- `notificationType`: A `CustomNotificationType` record that is queried based on the 'Sync_Notification' developer name. It is used to send custom notifications.
  
- `owa`: An `OrgWideEmailAddress` record fetched based on the display name 'Syncx', used as the sender address for emails.

### Use Case
This class is specifically used in triggers or batch processes where `Compliance_Credential__c` records are created or updated. It handles the business logic of identifying the type of change (e.g., a new submission, document back in process, privileges submitted or accepted) and sends appropriate notifications and emails to involved parties such as the contact who created the record, credentialing contacts, and account managers.

### Important Notes
- The inclusion of checks for null in many places ensures that the method can handle partial data gracefully.
- The capability to send emails is currently commented out, reflecting a possible need for selective enabling based on circumstances or configurations.
- The construction of email messages and notifications is done separately, allowing for easy customization of each type of communication.
- CustomNotification and Messaging.SingleEmailMessage objects rely on specific Salesforce setup (e.g., `OrgWideEmailAddress`, `CustomNotificationType`) which must be pre-configured in the org for the class to function correctly.
- The method `fetchComplianceCredentialsForNotifications` executes SOQL queries inside a loop, which could potentially lead to governor limit issues if not carefully managed or if bulk processed records exceed limit thresholds.
