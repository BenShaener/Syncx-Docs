**Description**: 
This class is designed to identify and process accounts that require invoices to be generated based on certain criteria such as the account's work location, timesheets, and expenses. It implements the `Database.Batchable<SObject>` interface, allowing it to be executed as a batch job within Salesforce. This job goes through accounts, gathers related timesheets and expenses approved within a specified week, generates invoices for them, and updates the related records to reflect the generation of these invoices.

**Methods**:
1. `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices(Date weekEnd)`: Constructor to initialize the class with a specific weekend date.
2. `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices(Date weekEnd, Id worklocationId)`: Overloaded constructor to initialize the class with a weekend date and a specific work location.
3. `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices()`: Default constructor.
4. `start(Database.BatchableContext bc)`: Prepares a SOQL query to fetch accounts based on whether a work location ID is provided.
5. `execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List<Account> scope)`: Main logic for generating invoices for each account in the provided list. Processes timesheets and expenses, creates invoices, and updates records as necessary.
6. `finish(Database.BatchableContext bc)`: Final method run after `execute` to handle any post-processing, such as generating PDFs for newly created invoices.

**Properties**:
1. `weekEnd`: Holds the end of the week date for which the invoices are being generated.
2. `worklocationId`: Optional ID to specify a work location for fetching related accounts.
3. `agencyInvoiceRtId`: RecordTypeId for agency invoices, fetched dynamically based on `nuInvoice__c` object.
4. `companyInvoiceRtId`: RecordTypeId for company invoices, fetched dynamically based on `nuInvoice__c` object.

**Use Case**:
This class is used to automate the invoice generation process for both agencies and companies associated with accounts in Salesforce. It is particularly useful for managing billing and invoicing in staffing or recruitment agencies where there are numerous transactions related to placements, timesheets, and expenses that need to be billed on a weekly basis.

**Important Notes**:
- The batch job's behavior can be customized using the constructors to process invoices for a specific week and/or a specific work location.
- It uses a mix of queries and in-memory processing to gather necessary data, create invoices, and update records accordingly.
- It's crucial to ensure that the batch size is appropriately set when scheduling or executing this batch job to avoid hitting governor limits.
- Error handling is implemented in the method responsible for generating PDFs from invoices to ensure stability and traceability.
- This class does not share its data access context with other parts of the application (`without sharing` keyword), meaning it runs with system-level access and ignores the user's permission set. This is important for data security considerations and should be accounted for during deployment.
