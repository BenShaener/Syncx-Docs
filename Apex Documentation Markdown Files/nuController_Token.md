### Description
This class is designed to handle token verification for timesheet records in Salesforce. It retrieves a timesheet record based on its ID, fetches or initializes a token for that timesheet, and allows for the verification of the token through a user input mechanism. 

### Methods

- `nuController_Token()`: Constructor that initializes class properties, retrieves the current page's record ID, and fetches the corresponding timesheet record along with its token.

    ```java
    public nuController_Token()
    ```

- `verifyToken()`: Verifies if the provided input token matches the existing token for the timesheet. Depending on the verification outcome, it either redirects the user to a specified URL or displays a message indicating an incorrect token.

    ```java
    public PageReference verifyToken()
    ```

### Properties

- `timeSheet`: Public getter and private setter. Holds the timesheet record fetched based on the record ID.

    ```java
    public nuTimesheet__c timeSheet { get; private set; }
    ```

- `timeSheetData`: Public getter and private setter. Stores timesheet record data for internal use.

    ```java
    public nuTimesheet__c timeSheetData { get; private set; }
    ```

- `message`: Public getter and setter. Utilized for conveying messages to the user based on token verification outcomes.

    ```java
    public String message { get; set; }
    ```

- `inputValue`: Public getter and setter. Stores the token input by the user for verification purposes.

    ```java
    public String inputValue { get; set; }
    ```

### Use Case
This class is useful in scenarios where a token-based verification is required for timesheet approvals. It could be used in a visualforce page where users enter a token to approve their timesheets. The token verification ensures that timesheets are approved by the correct individuals and helps in reducing fraudulent activities.

### Important Notes
- The constructor executes SOQL queries to retrieve timesheet records; thus, it's essential to be mindful of governor limits when using this class in bulk operations.
- The `verifyToken` method relies on an external URL (configured in a custom setting) for the success redirection. Ensure that this URL is correctly set up in your Salesforce org's custom settings.
- Security: Since this class does not enforce sharing rules (`without sharing` keyword), be cautious about the contexts in which it's used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.
