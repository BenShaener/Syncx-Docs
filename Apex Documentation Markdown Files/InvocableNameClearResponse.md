### Description
This class defines the response structure for a process or flow that clears a name or set of names within the Salesforce environment. It is specifically designed to be used with Salesforce's invocable methods, allowing it to be easily integrated into Salesforce's automation tools like Process Builder and Flow.

### Methods
This class does not define any methods. It serves solely as a data structure for holding the response from an invocable method that clears names.

### Properties
- **ncId:** This global ID property holds the identifier of the name clear request.
  ```java
  @InvocableVariable global ID ncId;
  ```
- **sendNameClearRequestAlert:** This global Boolean indicates whether an alert should be sent for the name clear request.
  ```java
  @InvocableVariable global Boolean sendNameClearRequestAlert;
  ```

### Use Case
An example use case for this class is when an administrator or developer has set up an automated process to clear certain names from the system, such as removing temporary or duplicate names from records. Upon completion of the name clear process, this response class can be used to signal whether the operation was successful and if an alert notification related to the name clearing process should be sent out. It works seamlessly with Salesforce's automation tools, making it simple to incorporate into a wide variety of automated workflows.

### Important Notes
- This class does not contain any executable logic or methods; it is a structure used for passing data.
- Being marked as `global`, both the class and its fields are accessible across namespaces which makes it suitable for use in managed packages or when sharing data across different Salesforce orgs or applications.
- Custom processes or flows that call invocable methods using this class need to properly interpret the `sendNameClearRequestAlert` flag to ensure alerts are sent according to the intended logic.
