### Description
This Apex class acts as a page controller designed for Salesforce communities. Its primary function is to redirect users to an appropriate start page when they navigate to a community site, based on their credentials or the absence thereof.

### Methods
- **forwardToStartPage()**: This method does not take any parameters and returns a `PageReference` object. It utilizes the `Network.communitiesLanding()` method to determine the correct landing page for the current user, based on their access rights or login state, and redirects them accordingly.

  ```java
  public PageReference forwardToStartPage() {
      return Network.communitiesLanding();
  }
  ```

### Properties
This class does not explicitly declare any properties.

### Use Case
A typical use case for this class is in the context of Salesforce communities where there is a need to dynamically direct users to different pages upon their arrival at the community site. This is particularly useful for:
- **Guest users**: Redirecting them to a login or information page.
- **Authenticated users**: Directing them to a home or dashboard page tailored to their role or membership level within the community.

Upon configuring a Visualforce page with this controller, the corresponding `forwardToStartPage` method can be called during the page load to achieve the redirection.

### Important Notes
- This controller is marked with the `with sharing` keyword, meaning it respects the user's permissions and sharing rules when accessing records. This is an important consideration in a community context to ensure that data visibility and access are correctly enforced.
- The actual determination of the start page logic is handled internally by the `Network.communitiesLanding()` method, making this controller's implementation sleek and simple but also dependent on the underlying platform behavior.
