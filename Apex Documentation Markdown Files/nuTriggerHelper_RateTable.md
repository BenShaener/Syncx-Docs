### Description
This class is designed to handle notifications for changes to `Rate_Table__c` records. It creates tasks, sends out custom notifications, and emails to the Synchronized Account Manager associated with the client of each rate table, based on specific conditions. Whether a rate table is newly created or updated with approval or decline changes, respective notifications and tasks are generated accordingly.

### Methods
- `handleNotifications(List<Rate_Table__c> newTables, Map<Id, Rate_Table__c> oldTablesMap)`: This method takes a list of new `Rate_Table__c` records along with a map of old (before update) rate table records keyed by their ID. It processes these records to send out custom notifications, emails, and create tasks based on the rate tables' current state and changes.

### Properties
- `notificationType`: Holds the `CustomNotificationType` record queried based on the DeveloperName = 'Sync_Notification'. This property is used to set the type of the custom notifications sent out.

### Use Case
Consider you need to automate communication and task creation for changes to rate tables within your organization. Specifically, when a new rate table is created or when an existing one is approved or declined:
- For new rate tables, it sends a custom notification and an email to the Synchronized Account Manager's email address and creates a task for them.
- For updated rate tables, if the approved or declined status changes, it sends out a custom notification with the specific state (approved or declined), sends an email to the Synchronized Account Manager, and creates a task.

This process ensures that Synchronized Account Managers are automatically informed about crucial updates to rate tables related to their clients.

### Important Notes
- The method `handleNotifications` assumes the presence of records in the `CustomNotificationType` and `OrgWideEmailAddress` tables matching specific criteria.
- This automation might result in multiple DML operations and queries; hence, it's crucial to be aware of governor limits.
- The presence of null checks and the use of optional chaining (`?.`) suggests defensive programming, but careful consideration should be given to ensure that all referenced relationships (like `Client__r.Synchronized_Account_Manager__r`) are available to avoid null pointer exceptions.
- Custom methods such as `nuHelper_Queues.filterSet` and `nuHelper_Queues.filterList` indicate dependency on external utility classes, which are not defined within the provided code snippet.
- It directly inserts tasks without checks on the list size, which might hit governor limits if the `rateTables` list is large.
- The method extensively uses SOQL queries inside for loops for fetching `OrgWideEmailAddress`; it's recommended to refactor to avoid SOQL queries inside loops to prevent hitting governor limits.
