### Description
This class provides a set of methods designed to manage various aspects of hiring workflows within a Salesforce environment. It includes functionalities for submitting candidates, saving events related to these candidates, creating placements, handling email alerts, and managing candidate name clearance processes.

### Methods
1. `submitCandidate(String candidateId, String jobOrderId, String agencyId)`:
   - Submits a candidate for a job order, creates a hiring audit record, and optionally sends an email alert.
   - Returns the `Id` of the created `Hiring_Audit__c` record if successful, `null` if the record already exists.

2. `saveEvent(String subject, DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate, String description, String candidateId, String hiringAuditId)`:
   - Creates an `Event` record related to a hiring audit and the candidate.
   - Returns the `Id` of the created `Event` record.

3. `createPlacement(String hiringAuditId)`:
   - Updates the hiring audit record to a new stage ('Assignment') and status ('Both Parties Accepted').
   - Returns the `Placement__c` field value from the updated `Hiring_Audit__c`.

4. `nameClearDecline(Id agency, Id hiringAuditId, Date expirationDate, String textForDecline, Boolean option)`:
   - Manages the name clearance process for a candidate, including setting status and comments for clear or not clear based on the provided option.

5. `private static void sendEmailAlert(Hiring_Audit__c hiringAudit)`:
   - Sends an email alert using a predefined template and org-wide email address to the client contact associated with the hiring audit.

### Properties
- This class does not explicitly declare properties (attributes or state variables) but manipulates records related to candidates, job orders, hiring audits, events, and name clearances within its methods.

### Use Case
The class is suited for organizations using Salesforce to manage their hiring processes. It allows seamless management of candidates' submissions, event scheduling related to the hiring process, placement creations once a candidate is selected, and handling of name clearance processes. It ensures that hiring audit trails are appropriately managed and supports sending email notifications as part of the workflow.

### Important Notes
- All methods are marked with `@AuraEnabled`, indicating they can be called from Lightning Components or Aura Applications, making the class suitable for use in Salesforce Lightning Experience.
- The `submitCandidate` and `saveEvent` methods make use of DML operations and SOQL queries, and `submitCandidate` checks for existing `Hiring_Audit__c` records to prevent duplicates.
- The `createPlacement` method updates a `Hiring_Audit__c` record to indicate that the hiring process has moved to the assignment stage.
- The `sendEmailAlert` method is used internally to send email notifications based on hiring audit activities and leverages Salesforce's single email message functionality.
- Exception handling is used throughout to capture and rethrow exceptions as `AuraHandledException`, making error messages more user-friendly in the Salesforce Lightning Experience.
- The class utilizes Salesforce best practices, including bulkified SOQL queries, proper exception handling, and efficient DML operations.
