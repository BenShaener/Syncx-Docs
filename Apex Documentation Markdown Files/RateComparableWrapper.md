### Description
This class provides a wrapper for the `Rate__c` custom object, allowing instances of it to be compared based on a calculated duration derived from start and end times. It implements the `Comparable` interface to enable sorting of `Rate__c` records according to this logic.

### Methods
- `RateComparableWrapper(Rate__c r)`: Constructor that initializes the wrapper with a `Rate__c` object.
  
```java
public RateComparableWrapper(Rate__c r) {
    rate = r;
}
```

- `global integer compareTo(Object r)`: Compares the current object with another object of the same type. It parses and calculates the duration between the start and end times of a shift and compares them to determine the order.

```java
global integer compareTo(Object r) {
    // Implementation details omitted for brevity
}
```

### Properties
- `public Rate__c rate`: The `Rate__c` object being wrapped by this class.

### Use Case
Utilize this wrapper class in scenarios where you need to sort a list of `Rate__c` records based on the duration of the shift defined by `Shift_Start_Time__c` and `Shift_End_Time__c` fields. An example might be generating a sorted schedule or prioritizing shifts based on their duration.

### Important Notes
- The comparison logic assumes that `Shift_Start_Time__c` and `Shift_End_Time__c` are strings that may contain numbers, am/pm indicators, and possibly other non-numeric characters. It is optimized for time formats that could include hours alone or hours and minutes, with a potential "p" indicating PM.
- The method removes non-numeric characters and performs arithmetic to normalize times to a 24-hour format, aiding in the comparison process.
- If start and end times result in the same duration for two `Rate__c` objects, the `compareTo` method returns 0, indicating equality in the context of sorting.
- The class and its methods are marked `global`, allowing for use across different namespace contexts within Salesforce, making it suitable for managed packages.
