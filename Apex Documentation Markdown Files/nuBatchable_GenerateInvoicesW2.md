**Description**: This class is designed to generate invoices in a batch operation for accounts based on specific criteria. It targets both 'Agency_Invoice' and 'Company_Invoice' record types of custom object `nuInvoice__c`. It processes approved timesheets and expenses within a specified date range for clients and agencies, assigning them to new invoices or updating existing entries accordingly.

**Methods**:
1. **Constructor Methods**:
    - `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoicesW2(Date weekEnd)`: Initializes batch with a specific week end date.
    - `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoicesW2(Date weekEnd, Id worklocationId)`: Initializes batch with a specified week end date and work location ID.
    - `nuBatchable_GenerateInvoicesW2()`: Default constructor.

2. **start(Database.BatchableContext bc)**:
    - Returns a `Database.QueryLocator` object for the batch job to process. The query fetches accounts based on the presence of a work location ID or defaults to fetching accounts with a 'Candidate_Pool' record type.

3. **execute(Database.BatchableContext bc, List<Account> scope)**:
    - Processes the list of `Account` records provided by the batch start method. It retrieves and processes associated `nuTimesheet__c` and `nuExpense__c` records within a specific timeframe, creating or updating `nuInvoice__c` records accordingly.

4. **finish(Database.BatchableContext bc)**:
    - Placeholder for any post-processing operations after batch execution.

**Properties**:
1. `weekEnd`: Specifies the end of the week date for filtering records. Defaults to today's date.
2. `worklocationId`: The ID of the work location to filter accounts.
3. `agencyInvoiceRtId`: Stores the record type ID for 'Agency_Invoice'.
4. `companyInvoiceRtId`: Stores the record type ID for 'Company_Invoice'.

**Use Case**:
This batch class is used to generate invoices for agency and company invoices based on approved timesheets and expenses that have not yet been invoiced. It is capable of processing records based on a specific week ending date and can filter by work location.

**Important Notes**:
- The `execute` method includes logic to categorize timesheets and expenses by agency and provider, prepare and update invoices accordingly.
- It makes use of nested loops and queries within the `execute` method which can lead to limits being reached on larger data sets. Careful consideration of batch size and data volume is necessary.
- The class utilizes hardcoded queries and record type names which may require updates if the underlying schema changes.
- Unimplemented logic in `finish` method suggests potential for further extension, such as notification dispatch or audit logging upon batch completion.
