### Description

This class represents a timesheet entity designed to track various details related to an employee's work hours, including regular, overtime, and holiday hours, as well as expenses incurred. It is structured to support interactions with Salesforce Aura Components, making it an integral part of a larger Salesforce-based application intended for timesheet management.

### Methods

This class does not define any explicit methods but exposes a number of properties using the `@AuraEnabled` annotation, making them accessible for Salesforce Aura & Lightning Web Components.

### Use Case

This class is used within a Salesforce application to represent and store details of an employee's timesheet, including hours worked across different categories and related expenses. It facilitates the display, creation, and modification of timesheet data in a user interface enabled by Salesforce Aura or Lightning Web Components.

### Important Notes

- The class is marked with `without sharing` to denote that it does not enforce the sharing rules established in Salesforce, which might affect the visibility and access control of the timesheet data.
  
- Being decorated with `@AuraEnabled`, the properties are accessible from Aura and Lightning components, allowing for rich, interactive user interfaces that can display or modify timesheet information.

- Special consideration should be given to the `readonly` property, which if true, indicates that the timesheet should not be modified, possibly reflecting a finalized or approved state.

- The class does not contain methods for manipulation or calculation of data, meaning these responsibilities are handled externally, likely within controllers or helper classes specific to the Aura or LWC framework.
  
- Integration with other systems or custom logic for validation, workflow progression, or reporting is implied to be managed outside of this class, requiring complementary Apex classes or Salesforce configurations.
