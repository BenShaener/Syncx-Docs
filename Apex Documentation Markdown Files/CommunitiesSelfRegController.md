### Description
This class is designed to facilitate self-registration of users in Salesforce communities that support this feature. It collects the user's basic information and handles the registration process, including validation and user creation within the community.

### Methods

- **CommunitiesSelfRegController()**: A constructor that retrieves the 'expid' parameter from the current page's URL and sets the experience ID if it exists.

- **registerUser()**: This method attempts to register the user with the details provided. If validation passes and the user is successfully created, it either logs in the user immediately or redirects to a confirmation page, based on the provided password.

### Properties

- **firstName**: The user's first name.
- **lastName**: The user's last name.
- **email**: The user's email address.
- **password**: The user's password; it is trimmed for leading and trailing spaces unless null.
- **confirmPassword**: A confirmation for the user's password; also trimmed unless null.
- **communityNickname**: The user's nickname within the community; trimmed unless null.

### Use Case
This controller is particularly useful in scenarios where an organization running a Salesforce community wants to allow new users to register themselves, streamlining the process of joining the community. It can be used in a custom community registration page.

### Important Notes
- The `registerUser` method contains placeholders (`null` values) for `profileId`, `roleEnum`, and `accountId`. These should be implemented based on the specific requirements of the community and user profiles.
- The method includes basic password validation (checking that the password and confirmation match) but does not comprehensively enforce security policies around password strength or complexity. Additional validation might be necessary depending on community security requirements.
- Errors encountered during the user creation process are logged for debugging purposes but are not displayed on the UI. Itâ€™s crucial to handle these errors appropriately in a production environment to inform users of the issue without exposing sensitive information.
