### Description

This class provides functionality to fetch rate records based on different identifiers like job order ID, rate table ID, hiring audit ID, and assignment ID. It acts as a service layer to communicate with a gateway class `nuGateway_RateTable` for retrieving `Rate__c` records from Salesforce. The class is marked as `without sharing` to explicitly not enforce record sharing rules.

### Methods

1. **fetchRatesFromJobOrder**
   
   ```java
   @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
   public static List<Rate__c> fetchRatesFromJobOrder(Id jobOrderId)
   ```
   
   Fetches rate records associated with a specified job order ID.
   
2. **fetchRates**
   
   ```java
   @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
   public static List<Rate__c> fetchRates(Id rateTableId)
   ```
   
   Retrieves rate records using a rate table ID.
   
3. **fetchRatesFromHiringAudit**
   
   ```java
   @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
   public static List<Rate__c> fetchRatesFromHiringAudit(Id hiringAuditId)
   ```
   
   Obtains rate records linked to a specific hiring audit ID.

4. **fetchRatesFromAssignment**
   
   ```java

### Use Case

This class can be utilized whenever there is a need to fetch `Rate__c` records for various entities like job orders, rate tables, hiring audits, or assignments within Salesforce. It is especially useful in scenarios where the fetched rates need to be displayed or processed in Salesforce Lightning components or Aura applications, benefiting from the cacheable nature of the methods to enhance performance and reduce server round trips.

### Important Notes

1. The class has been defined as `without sharing` which means it will not respect the organization's sharing rules. This behavior should be carefully considered and reviewed to ensure that it doesn't unintentionally expose sensitive data.

2. Since all methods are static and `@AuraEnabled`, they can be called directly from Lightning components, making it easy to fetch necessary data for the client-side. However, ensure the user has the necessary permissions to access the `Rate__c` object and its fields.

3. The `cacheable=true` attribute on the methods suggests that the results can be cached by the Lightning Aura Components framework. This improves the performance of applications that frequently require the same data. However, it's essential to consider the freshness of data and how it might impact the application.
