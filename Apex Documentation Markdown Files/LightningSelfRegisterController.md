### Description
This controller provides functionalities for self-registering users in a Salesforce community, including password validation, user creation with extra fields, and handling community experiences. It utilizes `@AuraEnabled` methods to allow interaction with Salesforce Lightning Components.

### Methods

- **selfRegister**: Registers a new user in the Salesforce community.
  ```java
  public static String selfRegister(String firstname, String lastname, String email, String password, String confirmPassword, String accountId, String regConfirmUrl, String extraFields, String startUrl, Boolean includePassword)
  ```
- **getExtraFields**: Retrieves extra fields for user registration based on a given Field Set.
  ```java
  public static List<Map<String,Object>> getExtraFields(String extraFieldsFieldSet)
  ```
- **setExperienceId**: Sets the experience Id for the current site or community.
  ```java
  global static String setExperienceId(String expId)
  ```
- **isValidPassword** (private): Validates if the provided password matches the confirm password.
  ```java
  private static boolean isValidPassword(String password, String confirmPassword)
  ```
- **siteAsContainerEnabled** (private): Checks if the community is configured to use the site as a container.
  ```java
  private static boolean siteAsContainerEnabled(String communityUrl)
  ```
- **validatePassword** (private): Validates the password against Salesforce's password policies.
  ```java
  private static void validatePassword(User u, String password, String confirmPassword)
  ```

### Properties
There are no public properties.

### Use Case
This controller can be used in scenarios where an organization wants to enable self-registration for their Salesforce community. It allows for a highly customizable registration process, including validation and setting specific configurations based on community needs.

### Important Notes
- The `selfRegister` method includes several validation checks and respects Salesforce's password policies.
- It uses dynamic Apex to handle `extraFields`, allowing for great flexibility in registration form customization.
- Use of `Database.setSavepoint()` and `Database.rollback()` ensures database operations are safely handled.
- It leverages Salesforce's built-in `Site` and `Auth` methods for user creation and authentication configurations.
- Test methods can interact with private methods using the `@TestVisible` annotation for better code coverage and testing.
- Incorporating Lightning and Aura Framework utilities (`@AuraEnabled`, `ApexPages.PageReference`) facilitates seamless front-end to back-end integration in Salesforce Lightning Experience.
