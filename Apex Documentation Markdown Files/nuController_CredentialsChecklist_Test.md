### Description
This class tests the functionality provided by `nuController_CredentialsChecklist`, specifically focusing on how it handles retrieving and counting placements in the credentialing process for contacts. It tests the system's behavior when:
- Data is present and fulfills the process criteria.
- Data is deleted, therefore not available to fulfill process criteria.
- Counting the instances of placements in the credentialing process for a given contact.

### Methods
- `makeData()`: Sets up the necessary test data including creating custom settings, accounts, contacts, job orders, hiring audits, placements, credentials, and compliance requirements.
- `testControllerWithDataAvailable()`: Verifies that the controller can successfully retrieve placements in the credentialing process when data is available.
- `testControllerWithoutDataAvailable()`: Checks the controller's behavior when no data is available to be retrieved, expecting an `AuraHandledException`.
- `testCount()`: Tests the controller's ability to count placements in the credentialing process correctly.

### Properties
- There are no properties directly defined within this test class; however, it uses external properties from the `nuMockFactory` class to create necessary Salesforce objects for testing purposes.

### Use Case
This test class should be employed whenever modifications are made to the `nuController_CredentialsChecklist` to ensure that its key functionalities remain intact and are working as expected. It is crucial in validating the system's ability to manage and track the credentialing process of placements associated with a specific contact, in both scenarios where data is present and when it is absent. 

### Important Notes
- Test data creation is accomplished via a separate factory class, `nuMockFactory`, which is not detailed in this documentation. It implies the need for this factory class to be correctly implemented and functioning for these tests to pass.
- The tests are designed to run in a specific Salesforce context where certain custom objects (`NUCSH__c`, `Job_Order__c`, `Hiring_Audit__c`, `nuPlacement__c`, `Credential__c`, and `Compliance_Requirement__c`) are presumed to exist. These objects must be part of the Salesforce org's schema for tests to execute successfully.
- The logic assumes the presence of a specific record type for the Contact object (`Candidate`), which must be set up beforehand in the Salesforce org.
- The class utilizes the `AuraHandledException` exception class to manage exceptions, which suggests that part of its intended use is within Salesforce Lightning components or applications.
- There's a dedicated method, `testControllerWithoutDataAvailable()`, designed to specifically check for robust error handling when no data fulfills the required conditions, highlighting the importance of graceful failure in the system's design.
