### Description
This class encapsulates the details of a job order release. It contains information related to a job order, such as its unique identifier and name, as well as the associated release and agency details. The class is designed to be used in environments where Salesforce Lightning components interact with Apex code, as indicated by the `@AuraEnabled` annotation. 

### Methods
This class does not define any methods. It serves primarily as a data container.

### Properties
- **releaseId**: A string property that holds the unique identifier of the release.
```java
@AuraEnabled
public string releaseId {get; set;}
```
- **releaseName**: A string property that contains the name of the release.
```java
@AuraEnabled
public string releaseName {get; set;}
```
- **jobOrderId**: A string property that stores the unique identifier of the job order.
```java
@AuraEnabled
public string jobOrderId {get; set;}
```

```

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful in scenarios involving Salesforce Lightning applications where detailed information regarding a job order release needs to be displayed or processed. It can be instantiated and populated with relevant data, which can then be passed back and forth between Salesforce Lightning components and Apex controllers.

### Important Notes
- All properties are accessible from Salesforce Lightning components due to the `@AuraEnabled` annotation.
- There are no explicit security settings enforced within the class itself (`without sharing` is specified), so it inherits the sharing settings of the invoking context.
- This class does not perform any operations by itself. It is purely a structure for holding data related to a job order release.
