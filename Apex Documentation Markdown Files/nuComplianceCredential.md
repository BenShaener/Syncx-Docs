### Description

This Apex class represents a compliance credential object with various properties to hold information such as the credential's ID, name, deadline, current stage, status, requirement, credential detail, instructions, and reason for moving back a stage. This class is designed to be accessible from Lightning components due to the `@AuraEnabled` annotation.

### Methods

This class does not contain explicit methods beyond the getter and setter methods automatically provided for properties by the Apex language. The `@AuraEnabled` annotation on each property ensures that these properties can be accessed from Salesforce Lightning components for CRUD operations.

### Properties

- **complianceCredentialId:** Holds the unique identifier for the compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public string complianceCredentialId {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **name:** Represents the name of the compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public string name {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **deadline:** Specifies the deadline date for the compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public Date deadline {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **currentStage:** Indicates the current stage of the compliance credential's lifecycle.
  
  ```java
  public string currentStage {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **status:** Represents the current status of the compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public string status {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **requirement:** Details the requirement(s) for this compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public string requirement {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **credential:** Contains detailed information about the credential itself.
  
  ```java
  public string credential {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **instructions:** Provides instructions related to the compliance credential.
  
  ```java
  public string instructions {get; set;}
  ```
  
- **reasonMovingBack:** Specifies the reason for moving back the compliance credential to a previous stage.
  
  ```java
  public string reasonMovingBack {get; set;}
  ```

### Use Case

This class can be used in Salesforce Lightning components to display detailed information about a compliance credential, manage its lifecycle (by tracking its current stage and status), update information based on user actions (e.g., updating the reason for moving back a stage), and ensure all necessary requirements and instructions are clearly communicated to the user.

### Important Notes

- The class is declared with `without sharing` keyword, indicating that it does not enforce sharing rules. This means it will run in the system context and not in the user's context, which may be important for organizations to consider from a security perspective.
  
- The `@AuraEnabled` annotation is crucial for accessing the properties from Lightning components. However, developers need to ensure proper access controls and sharing settings are enforced elsewhere to protect sensitive information.
