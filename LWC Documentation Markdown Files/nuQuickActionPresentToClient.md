### Description
`NuQuickActionPresentToClient` is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) intended for presentation purposes in the Hiring Audit process flow. The main functionality of this component centers around marking a specific Hiring Audit record as "Presented to Client" within Salesforce. It utilizes standard Salesforce UI elements like modals and spinners for feedback during the operation.

### Properties

1. `hiringAuditId`: 

    - Type: `@api`
    - Description: A public property to store the ID of the Hiring Audit record. The value is passed into the component, enabling it to perform operations related to that specific record.

2. `quickActionLabel`: 

    - Type: `@api`
    - Description: A public property intended to store a label for the quick action. This property can be used to dynamically set the modal's title or button labels but is currently not utilized in the visible part of the provided code.

3. `showSpinner`: 

    - Type: `Boolean`
    - Description: A private property used to control the visibility of the loading spinner, providing user feedback during asynchronous operations.

### Methods

1. `connectedCallback()`:

    - Visibility: Private
    - Description: Lifecycle hook that's called when the component is inserted into the DOM. It starts an operation to update the Hiring Audit record's status to "Presented to Client" (`HA_STATUS_FIELD`).

2. `closeQuickAction(event)`:

    - Visibility: Private
    - Parameters: `event` - The event object that initiated the method call.
    - Description: Dispatches a `finishquickaction` event to signal the completion of the quick action, allowing parent components or handlers to respond accordingly.

3. `doSubmit(event)` (Commented out):

    - Visibility: Private
    - Parameters: `event` - The event object that initiated the method call.
    - Description: *Commented Out* â€” Intended for submitting form data collected from the user through input fields in the component's template. Dispatches updates to the record and emits a `finishquickaction` event upon completion.

### Use Case
In a Salesforce implementation related to hiring processes, this component can be used to quickly mark a Hiring Audit record as "Presented to Client" without the need for the user to manually edit the record. This can streamline workflows and improve user experience by reducing the number of steps required to update record statuses.

### Important Notes

- The component contains sections of code that have been commented out, including a modal form intended for user input and a method (`doSubmit(event)`) for handling form submission. To fully utilize these parts of the component, the corresponding code must be uncommented and potentially modified to suit specific requirements.

- The `@wire` decorator and associated handler method for fetching the Hiring Audit record have also been commented out. To incorporate data retrieval into the component, this section should be uncommented and adjusted as needed.

- There are Salesforce schema imports (`HA_CANDIDATE_FIELD`, `HA_STAGE_FIELD`, `HA_STATUS_FIELD`) used in the JS code, indicating the component's reliance on specific custom fields that must exist in the Salesforce environment for proper function.

- Use of `updateRecord` from the `lightning/uiRecordApi` module is demonstrated, showcasing how to programmatically update Salesforce records within LWCs.

Example of emitting an event upon closing the quick action:
```javascript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('finishquickaction'));
```

The component's current configured functionality primarily involves automatic background processes (e.g., updating a record's field upon component initialization) rather than direct interaction via a UI form.
