### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to manage and display hiring audits in a Kanban-style interface. It allows users to filter hiring audits based on various criteria such as specialty, candidate summary ID, candidate, location, and status using multi-select picklists. The component supports dragging and dropping hiring audits between stages and presents modals for certain actions like presenting a candidate or setting up an interview. It dynamically generates and updates the UI based on the available hiring audit data and user interactions.

### Methods

- **connectedCallback**: Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. It fetches initial data such as contact ID, account ID, and hiring audits.

- **handleListItemDrag**: Captures the ID of the hiring audit being dragged.

- **handleItemDrop**: Handles the drop action of a hiring audit item, potentially opening confirmation modals or updating the hiring audit's stage.

- **handleConfirmModal**: Handles the user's response in a confirmation modal, potentially proceeding with updating a hiring audit's stage.

- **handleFinishQuickAction**: Refreshes the hiring audits data after a quick action modal (presenting a candidate or setting up an interview) is completed.

- **updateHandler**: Updates the stage of a hiring audit using the `updateRecord` API.

- **handleSpecFilterChange, handleCSIDFilterChange, handleCandidateFilterChange, handleLocFilterChange, handleStatusFilterChange**: These methods handle changes in their respective filter picklists and trigger the filtering of hiring audits.

- **doFilter**: Applies all set filters to the hiring audits data, updating the view to reflect the filtered results.

### Properties

- **recordId**: Stores the ID of the currently selected hiring audit.
- **pickVals**: Tracks the picklist values for hiring audit stages.
- **hiringAudits**: Stores hiring audit data for display and manipulation.
- **containerStyle, sectionHeadingStyle**: Stores inline CSS styles for dynamic styling based on account settings.
- **isHa, showPresentsModal, showInterviewModal, accessToNavigationMixin**: Boolean flags for various component states and features.
- **locOptions, csIdOptions, specOptions, candidateOptions, statOptions**: Arrays storing options for each of the filterable criteria's picklists.
- **changeStageModal, confirmChange, changingStage**: Properties related to handling stage change confirmation modals.
- **wiresLoaded**: A boolean to check if wire service calls are completed.

### Use Case

This component is ideal for a recruitment or HR application within Salesforce, where managing and tracking the progress of hiring audits is crucial. It caters to the need for a visual representation of hiring audits across different stages of a recruitment process. The component allows users to filter the visibility of hiring audits based on diverse criteria making it easier to handle a large number of candidates. Additionally, it supports actions such as presenting candidates or setting up interviews directly from the Kanban board.

### Important Notes

1. **Dynamic Styling**: The component dynamically adjusts its styles based on account data, ensuring consistency with the portal's theme.
2. **Drag and Drop Functionality**: The implementation of drag-and-drop for moving hiring audits between stages may require additional libraries or platform support not shown in the provided code.
3. **Promise Handling in `handleItemDrop`**: This method uses Promises to handle asynchronous operations involved in updating a hiring audit's stage, including user confirmation.
4. **Refresh After Action**: The component refreshes its data after actions like updating a stage or completing a quick action to ensure the UI is up-to-date.
5. **Wire Service for Picklist Values**: The use of wire service to fetch picklist values for stages emphasizes the dynamic nature of the component, ensuring it adapts to changes in the underlying Salesforce metadata.

```javascript
// Sample code snippet to illustrate handling filter change
handleSpecFilterChange(event){
    let selectedValues = event.detail.value;
    let filterCriteria = [];
    selectedValues.forEach(selectedValue => {
        filterCriteria.push(selectedValue.label);
    });
    this.specFiter = filterCriteria;
    this.doFilter();
}
```
