### Description

The component `NuOrderJobDetailsAndRelatedList` is a comprehensive Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed for rendering detailed views associated with various Salesforce objects like Job Orders, Hiring Audits, and Placements. It supports viewing and editing details, quick actions for record processing, related lists for associated files, work logs, credit memos, chat functionalities, and more. It dynamically adjusts its behavior and presentation based on the object type and context, handling both client and agency portals while offering capabilities like PDF generation and ZIP file downloading for job orders.

### Properties

- `hiringAuditId`: For storing Hiring Audit ID.
- `recordId`: Universal property to store the current record ID being viewed or manipulated.
- `recordType`: Stores the type of the record.
- `isorderApprovalActionPanel`: Indicates if the approval action panel should be shown.

### Methods

- `handleVfPageMessage(event)`: Handles messages from the embedded Visualforce page, particularly for adjusting iframe heights.
- `runInit()`: Initial method called to fetch object names, setup styles, and prepare the component based on the context (client or agency).
- `handleFieldChange(event)`: Handles any change made to input fields on the form, adjusting UI dynamically based on field-specific logic.
- `handleEditMode()`: Enables or disables edit mode for the fields in the component.
- `handleFormSubmit(event)`: Placeholder for custom logic on form submission.
- `handleQuickAction(event)`: Triggers when a quick action is initiated by the user.
- `finishQuickAction(event)`: Handles the completion of a quick action and potentially navigates to a different record page based on the action's result.
- `loadMoreData(event)`: Method for loading more data dynamically into the datatable present in the component.
- `handleAssignmentFilesRowAction(event)`: Handles row actions in the Assignment Files datatable.

### Use Case

This LWC is well-suited for complex Salesforce objects related to job management or recruitment processes, where a detailed and interactive view of the object is required. This would include:

- Viewing detailed information of Job Orders, Hiring Audits, and Placements.
- Performing object-specific actions directly from the detail view (e.g., close job order, submit candidate).
- Managing related files, chat conversations, and other related records from the same interface.
- Editing records inline and handling dynamic UI changes based on the record type and field values.

### Important Notes

- The component uses a mix of LWC framework capabilities along with Apex backend support to fetch records, handle actions, and manage related lists.
- It utilizes `NavigationMixin` for handling navigation to different record pages or external URLs (like generated PDFs).
- The CSS part involves advanced styling to ensure the component maintains a consistent look and feel with Salesforce Design System standards, as well as responsive design considerations.
- Integration with Visualforce for specific functionalities like PDF generation is handled through message passing techniques.
- The component demonstrates a complex use of LWC lifecycle hooks, Salesforce schema import for referencing object fields, and wire service for reactive data fetching.
- Extensive use of `@api`, `@track`, and `@wire` decorators indicates a highly dynamic and data-driven component.
