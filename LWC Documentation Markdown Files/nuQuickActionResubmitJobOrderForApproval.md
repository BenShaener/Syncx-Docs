### Description

This component `NuQuickActionResubmitJobOrderForApproval` is designed to operate within the Salesforce Lightning Experience. It functions primarily as a UI modal dialog that allows users to resubmit a Job Order for approval through a Salesforce Lightning Flow. It displays a modal with a title "Resubmit Job Order for Approval". Upon record ID availability, it dynamically feeds the record ID to the flow named ‘Job_Order_resubmit_for_approval’ as an input variable, thus facilitating the approval process. The component also features functionality to close the modal dialog, handle the result status from the Lightning Flow execution, and present relevant messages to the user through toast notifications.

### Methods

1. **recordIdpopulated**: A getter method that checks if the `recordId` property is populated. If true, it sets the input variables for the flow and returns true.

    ```javascript
    get recordIdpopulated(){
        if (this.recordId != null && this.recordId != undefined){
            this.inputVariables =  [{
                name: 'recordId',
                type: 'String',
                value: this.recordId
            }];
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **closePopup**: Invokes the dispatch event to close the modal dialog. This is designed to be called when the close button within the modal header is clicked.

    ```javascript
    closePopup(){
        this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('finishquickaction'));
    }
    ```

3. **handleStatusChange**: Handles the status change of the Lightning Flow. Upon completion (`FINISHED` status), it closes the modal. In case of errors (`ERROR` status), it presents an error toast to the user and then closes the modal.

    ```javascript
    handleStatusChange(event) {
        if(event.detail.status === 'FINISHED'){
            this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('finishquickaction'));
        }
        else if(event.detail.status === 'ERROR'){
            const evt = new ShowToastEvent({
                title: 'Error',
                message: 'Most likely record do not match any approval process criteria',
                variant: 'error',
            });
            this.dispatchEvent(evt);
            this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('finishquickaction'));
        }
    }
    ```

### Properties

1. **recordId** (`@api`): This property is intended to receive the Salesforce record ID on which the job order resubmission for approval takes place. It's marked with `@api` for it to be publicly exposed to be set by the component's parent.

    ```javascript
    @api recordId;
    ```

### Use Case

This component is useful in scenarios where there is a need to resubmit Job Orders for approval directly from a UI without navigating away to different components or pages. For instance, this can be embedded in record pages for easy access to resubmit approvals.

### Important Notes

- This component is dependent on the `recordId` being passed by the parent component or context in which it is placed.
- It dynamically interacts with the Salesforce Flow named `Job_Order_resubmit_for_approval`, and as such, the flow needs to exist and be properly configured to accept the input variables as set by this component.
- The `handleStatusChange` method is crucial for feedback to users, particularly to handle any exceptions or errors gracefully.
- The CSS classes used are part of the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) and ensure that the modal dialog's UI is consistent with the Salesforce Lightning Experience UI.
