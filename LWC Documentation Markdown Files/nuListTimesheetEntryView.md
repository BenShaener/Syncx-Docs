This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of a Lightning Web Component used for displaying a list of timesheet entries in Salesforce. The component is called `NgListTimesheetEntryView` and is designed to render timesheet entries in either a vertical layout or a horizontal layout, with additional configuration options such as showing shifts, unpaid breaks, and notes.

### Description

`NgListTimesheetEntryView` is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) used to present timesheet entries. It supports various configurations like layout modes (vertical or horizontal), showing shifts, and handling time entries that spread across multiple days. This component is flexible and can be used in different contexts by adjusting its properties via the API.

### Methods

The component primarily relies on its lifecycle hooks (`connectedCallback`, `renderedCallback`) to execute code on component connection and post-render. It does not explicitly define custom methods but makes use of getters to compute derived state.

### Properties

The component exposes the following API properties:

- `debugVar`: Used for debugging purposes.
- `debugTarget`: Specifies the debug target.
- `mode`: Mode of the layout, e.g., 'Agency'.
- `layout`: Specifies the layout orientation ('vertical').
- `entries`: Holds the timesheet entries.
- `showSlotInput`: Boolean to show/hide slot input.
- `updatedDate`: Represents the date when entries were last updated.
- `editMode`: Boolean to toggle edit mode.
- `showShift`, `showUnpaidBreak`, `showNote`: Booleans to control the visibility of shifts, unpaid breaks, and notes, respectively.
- `autoBreakValue`: Numerical value for auto break.
- `shiftOptions`, `otShifts`, `multidayShifts`, `hoursOnlyShifts`, `breakShifts`, `unpaidBreakOptions`: Arrays that hold options for different configurations related to shifts and breaks.
- `clockInClockOut`: Boolean to toggle between clock in/out and simple hours mode.
- `multiDay`: Boolean to indicate if the entry spans multiple days.

### Use Case

This component can be utilized in applications or pages within Salesforce that require displaying or managing timesheet entries in a flexible manner. It supports various configurations to fit different business rules or UI requirements, such as displaying detailed shifts, handling multi-day entries, and allowing users to input or edit timesheet data directly.

### Important Notes

- This component makes extensive use of conditional rendering (`template if:true/if:false`) in the HTML template to dynamically adjust the display based on the component's state.
- It employs Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling, ensuring a consistent look and feel with the Salesforce platform.
- The component reacts to changes in its properties to fetch and refresh entries as needed (`get cachedEntries`).
- Debugging utilities are embedded for development and troubleshooting (`debugVar`, `debugTarget`, and logging functions).

### Example Usage

```html
<c-ng-list-timesheet-entry-view
    mode="Agency"
    layout="horizontal"
    entries={timesheetEntries}
    show-slot-input
    updated-date={lastUpdatedDate}
    show-shift
    show-note
    clock-in-clock-out
    multi-day>
</c-ng-list-timesheet-entry-view>
```

This example demonstrates how to use `NgListTimesheetEntryView` to display timesheet entries in a horizontal layout, showing the shift and note information for entries that have clock-in/clock-out times and span multiple days.
