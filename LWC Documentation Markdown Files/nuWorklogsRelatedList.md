### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuWorklogsRelatedList` is designed to display related work records in a datatable format within Salesforce. It dynamically retrieves worklogs either from an agency or a company based on what's relevant to the provided invoice ID. The component utilizes the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for consistent styling and the `lightning-datatable` component for displaying the records in a table format. It also incorporates navigation capabilities to generate URLs for individual worklog records.

### Methods

- **haddlePageRef(result):** This wired method handles the current page reference. It uses the `NavigationMixin.GenerateUrl` to generate base URLs for worklog and assignment links, adjusting them to point directly to specific records. Based on the `invoiceId`, it makes calls to either `getInvoiceRelatedCompanyWorklogs` or `getInvoiceRelatedAgencyWorklogs` Apex methods to fetch the worklogs. It then formats the worklogs data to ensure that the `lightning-datatable` can display it properly, including creating URLs for navigation to the worklog and assignment records.

- **connectedCallback():** This lifecycle hook runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. In the provided code, this method does not perform any action, as its body is empty.

### Properties

- **invoiceId:** (API property) This public property is intended to be set by the parent component to specify the invoice ID relevant to fetching the worklogs.

- **columns:** This property holds the configurations for the columns displayed in the `lightning-datatable`, including setting up fields for 'Worklog Name', 'Status', 'Week Start', 'Week End', and 'Assignment', with 'Worklog Name' and 'Assignment' as navigable URLs to the respective records.

- **worklogs:** (track) This reactive property stores the formatted worklogs fetched based on the provided `invoiceId`. The component's template uses this property to render the datatable based on current data.

### Use Case

This component can be used in Salesforce applications where there's a need to display related work records tied to a particular invoice in a list format. It's particularly useful in situations where easy navigation to individual worklog or assignment records is needed directly from the list.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the `@salesforce/apex/nuController_RelatedLists.getInvoiceRelatedAgencyWorklogs` and `@salesforce/apex/nuController_RelatedLists.getInvoiceRelatedCompanyWorklogs` Apex methods are properly implemented and accessible by this component. These methods should return lists of worklog records with at least the fields required by the component (e.g., `timesheetId`, `placementId`, etc.).

- Customize the `COLUMNS` constant as necessary to match the actual fields present in your worklog records and to meet any specific display requirements you have for the datatable.

- The component uses a combination of SLDS classes and custom CSS for styling. Adjustments to the CSS should be made with consideration to maintain consistency with the SLDS guidelines.

- The empty `connectedCallback()` method indicates that lifecycle actions might be planned for future enhancements. Implement logic within this method if you need the component to perform actions upon being added to the DOM.

```javascript
import { LightningElement, api, wire, track } from 'lwc';
// Import other necessary modules and Apex methods
```

This provides a basic structured way to understand the implementation and functioning of the `NuWorklogsRelatedList` Lightning Web Component.
