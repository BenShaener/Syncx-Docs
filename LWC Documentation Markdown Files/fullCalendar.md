### Description

This Salesforce Lightning component, named `FullCalendarComponent`, integrates a robust calendar view into Salesforce Lightning Experience, enabling users to schedule, view, and manage events dynamically. Leveraging the popular FullCalendar library, the component offers various views such as day, week, month, and list views, and supports operations like event creation, modification, and deletion.

### Methods

#### connectedCallback
Invoked when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initializes event listeners.

#### renderedCallback
Ensures FullCalendar and its dependencies are loaded and initialized. This is where the calendar is configured and rendered.

#### createEvent
Creates a new event on the calendar with specified details such as start time, end time, color, and more.

#### init
Initializes the FullCalendar instance with predefined options and plugins. It binds various FullCalendar events like `eventClick`, `dateClick`, and `select`.

#### nextHandler
Navigates the calendar to the next period based on the current view.

```js
@api nextHandler() {
    this.calendar.next();
    this.calendarLabel = this.calendar.view.title;
    this.removeEmptyEvents(this.calendar.getEvents());
}
```

#### previousHandler
Navigates the calendar to the previous period based on the current view.

#### dailyViewHandler, weeklyViewHandler, monthlyViewHandler, listViewHandler
Change the current calendar view to day, week, month, or list view respectively.

#### today
Navigates the calendar to today's date.

#### refresh
Refetches events and refreshes the calendar view.

#### removeEmptyEvents
Removes events without an ID from the calendar.

### Properties

The component exposes numerous `@api` properties such as `titleField`, `objectName`, `startField`, `endField`, etc., allowing you to customize the event source dynamically.

### Use Case

This component can be utilized in any Salesforce Lightning application that requires scheduling or event management functionality. For example, it could be used to manage conference rooms, track project milestones, or schedule staff shifts. It offers extensive customization options to tailor the calendar view and event handling as per specific business requirements.

### Important Notes

- The component depends on external libraries (`FullCalendar`, `FontAwesome`) loaded dynamically via `loadScript` and `loadStyle` methods. Ensure these resources are correctly uploaded to Salesforce static resources.
- The `eventSourceHandler` method integrates with custom Apex controllers to fetch and manipulate events. Make sure the Apex controllers are available and accessible by the Lightning component.
- Specific global variables (e.g., `objectName`, `startField`, `endField`, etc.) are declared outside the component class. These are utilized within `eventSourceHandler` for dynamic event fetching.
- The CSS classes (e.g., `.open-shift`, `.confirmed-shift`) mentioned define styles for different types of events and must be included in the component's stylesheet for optimal visual distinction.
- The component employs the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling, ensuring a consistent look and feel with the Salesforce environment.
- It's important to handle all potential exceptions or errors during the lifecycle hooks (especially in `renderedCallback`) to avoid breaking the user interface.
