### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuQuickActionFillRateTable` is designed to provide functionalities for handling rates related to hiring audits, job orders, and assignments. It enables users to view and edit rates, manage draft values for rate amendments, validate data, and navigate through different tabs presenting rate information in various contexts.

### Methods

- **connectedCallback**: Lifecycle hook which runs when the component is inserted into the document. It modifies the columns displayed based on the context (e.g., hiring audit vs. assignment).

- **fetchRates**, **fetchRatesFromJobOrder**, **fetchRatesFromAssignment**: Wired methods to fetch rates data from Apex controllers based on different contexts, such as hiring audits, job orders, and assignments.

- **updateDataValues**: Updates data values with the changes captured in the editable rate table.

- **updateDraftValues**: Updates the draft values as the user edits rows in the rate table, performs inline validations like checking if values deviate from recommended ranges.

- **handleCellChange**: Handler function that captures changes in the cell values and updates draft values.

- **handleSubmit**: Handles the form submission, which involves persisting the edited rates. Displays success or error messages as needed.

- **handleCancel**: Handles cancellation of edits by reverting to the last saved data.

- **refresh**: Refreshes the rate data displayed by re-fetching from the server.

- **handleNextButtonClick**: Handles click event on the "Next" button, validating the current content before moving forward in a multi-step process.

- **performValidation**: Performs validation on the rates data, ensuring data integrity before allowing further operations.

### Properties

- **columns**, **columnsNotEditable**, **columnsNotEditableJobOrder**, **columnsNotEditableHiringAudit**: Arrays defining the structure and behavior of columns in the data tables used for displaying rates information. These columns are adjusted based on the context, like whether the data is editable or not.

- **data**, **draftValues**, **errors**: Tracks the rates data, any draft (unsaved) changes, and any validation errors that occur.

- **presentedRateTab**, **rateTabJob**, **rateTabAssignment**: Boolean variables to control the visibility of different tabs or sections based on the context like presented rates, job order rates, etc.

- **showSpinner**: Boolean property used to control the display of a spinner UI component, indicating ongoing data operations.

### Use Case

This component is suited for scenarios where it is necessary to manage and edit rates associated with different entities like hiring audits, job orders, and assignments within Salesforce. It offers functionalities such as inline editing, validation against custom business logic, and dynamic adjustments of visible UI elements based on the context.

### Important Notes

- The component relies on Apex controllers for data retrieval and operations (`nuService_Contact`, `nuService_RateTable`), implying that it is part of a larger application with server-side logic.
  
- Data validation plays a significant role in the component's operation, highlighting the importance of accurate and meaningful data entry.

- The component is designed with reusability in mind, making adjustments based on the context like the type of rates being managed. This dynamic behavior necessitates careful testing across different scenarios to ensure consistency and reliability.
