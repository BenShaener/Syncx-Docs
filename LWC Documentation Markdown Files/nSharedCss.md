### Description

This documentation explains the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code for a Salesforce Lightning component. The provided code focuses primarily on defining custom CSS variables that establish a color scheme for the component. These variables can be used throughout the component's styles to ensure consistency and simplification of theme adjustments.

### Properties

The CSS code defines several custom properties (variables) that store color values. These variables are defined within the `:host` pseudo-class, making them available throughout the component's styles.

1. `--primary-color`: Represents the primary color used in the component (`#F5006B`).
2. `--primary-color-light-2`: A lighter variant of the primary color (`#d5f1f8`).
3. `--primary-color-dark`: A darker variant of the primary color (`#39b6dd`).
4. `--black`: Defines the color black (`#010101`).
5. `--grey`: Represents a standard grey color (`#5b5b5b`).
6. `--grey-light-1`: A lighter shade of grey (`#efefef`).
7. `--grey-light-2`: An even lighter shade of grey (`#f9f9f9`).
8. `--red`: Represents the color red.
9. `--green`: Represents the color green.
10. `--purple`: Represents the color purple.
11. `--orange`: Represents the color orange.
12. `--primary-background`: Defines the primary background color used in the component (`#f5f6f8`).

### Use Case

These CSS variables can be employed throughout the component's CSS file(s) to maintain color consistency and facilitate theme customization. For example, to set the background color of a class named `.myComponent` to the primary color, you would use:

```css
.myComponent {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

### Important Notes

- CSS variables defined in a Salesforce Lightning component using the `:host` pseudo-class are scoped to the component. This means they will not leak out and affect other components or the global style unless explicitly made global.
- Using CSS variables allows for easier maintenance and updates to themes or color schemes, as changes only need to be made in one place.
- Despite their benefits, ensure browser compatibility for your target audience since CSS variables have good but not universal support.
- Remember that CSS variables can be overwritten within the component to cater to specific needs, offering flexibility in styling different parts of the component differently while keeping the theme consistent.

This setup defines a clear, maintainable, and easily adjustable color scheme for Salesforce Lightning components, emphasizing the importance of using CSS variables for efficient style management.
