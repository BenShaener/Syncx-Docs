### Description

The `NNotificationBtn` is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed to serve as an interactive notification button, displaying notifications to the user when clicked. It has several key features:

- Shows an icon to indicate the notification status (new notifications available, no new notifications, etc.).
- Reveals a dropdown list that contains notification items when the notification icon is clicked.
- Supports navigation to a specific page when the notification icon is engaged with, particularly if no new notifications are present.
- Can dynamically display notifications count and handle the visibility of the notifications dropdown.

### Methods

#### `handleNotification(e)`
The `handleNotification` method is an event handler for clicks on the notification icon. It toggles the visibility of the notification dropdown, updates the `showNotifications` property, and may navigate the user to another page based on specified conditions.

Example usage:
```js
onclick={handleNotification}
```

#### `handleMouseOver(e)`
**Currently commented out in the template.** It is designed to upscale the notification icon on mouse over.

```js
// onmouseover={handleMouseOver} 
```

#### `handleMouseOut(e)`
**Currently commented out in the template.** It would reset the icon's scale back to normal when the mouse is moved away.

```js
// onmouseout={handleMouseOut}
```

### Properties

#### `notificationArr (@api)`
An array of notification objects. Each object in the array represents a notification item with properties that can be displayed in the notification dropdown.

#### `notificationDropdownStyle (@api)`
A string that represents custom styling for the notification dropdown. This allows for external customization of the dropdown's appearance.

#### `tileId (@api)`
A string representing the identifier of the specific tile associated with this notification button.

#### `tilePageName (@api)`
A string that specifies the name of the page to navigation to if certain conditions are met (no new notifications and the button is clicked).

#### `numberNotReadAccount (@api)`
An integer indicating the number of unread notifications relevant to the account.

### Use Case

The `NNotificationBtn` component is useful in user interfaces where notifications play a critical role in user interaction and information delivery. It can be used:

- On dashboards, to alert users about new activities or updates that require their attention.
- In applications with event-driven updates or communications that need to be acknowledged by the user.

### Important Notes

- The component's visibility and behavior can be customized using the exposed `@api` properties, such as `notificationArr` and `notificationDropdownStyle`.
- It is designed to be responsive, adapting its layout for desktop and mobile views using CSS media queries.
- The component relies on the parent component or application to provide notification data (`notificationArr`) and configuration (`tileId`, `tilePageName`).
- The CSS imports from 'c/nSharedCss' and 'c/nuCSS' indicate that the component is using shared styles, which need to be available in the Salesforce org for the component to render properly.
- Although commented out in the template, mouseover and mouseout handlers show potential for interaction effects that can enhance the user experience if enabled.
