## Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component, named `NuSearchablePicklist`, creates a customizable, searchable picklist input. It leverages the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) to provide a styled and interactive UI. Users can search through the picklist options by typing, and the component will filter and display matching options. Users can select an option by clicking it, and the component can operate in both editable and read-only modes.

## Methods

- **search(event):** Filters the `options` based on the user's input. It updates the `optionsSearch` with the filtered results, allowing users to see only the matching options.

```javascript
search(event) {
    this.defaultvalue = '';
    const input = event.detail.value.toLowerCase();
    const result = this.options.filter((picklistOption) =>
      picklistOption.label.toLowerCase().includes(input)
    );
    this.optionsSearch = result;
    this.selectedSearchResult = null;
}
```

- **selectSearchResult(event):** Updates the `selectedSearchResult` with the user's selection from the filtered options.

```javascript
selectSearchResult(event) {
    this.defaultvalue = '';
    const selectedValue = event.currentTarget.dataset.value;
    this.selectedSearchResult = this.options.find(
        (picklistOption) => picklistOption.value === selectedValue
    );
    
    this.clearSearchResults();
}
```

- **clearSearchResults:** Clears the search results and sets the focus state to `false`.

```javascript
clearSearchResults(event) {
    this.optionsSearch = null;
    this.focussed = false;
}
```

- **showPicklistOptions:** Displays the options when the input field is focused, if no search has been performed yet.

```javascript
showPicklistOptions() {
    if (!this.optionsSearch) {
        this.optionsSearch = this.options;
    }
}
```

- **handleDropdownClick, handleInputClick:** Prevents the dropdown from closing unexpectedly by managing focus and click events.

## Properties

- **@api options:** The list of options that can be searched and selected from.
- **@api optionsSearch:** The filtered list of options based on the search term.
- **@api selectedSearchResult:** Currently selected option from the filtered list.
- **@api defaultvalue:** The predefined value if any is to be selected upon component initialization.
- **@api selectedOption:** (Optional) Explicitly selected option, useful in scenarios where an external action determines the selection.
- **@track readOnly:** Determines if the component is in read-only mode.
- **@track type:** Indicates the type of input, dynamically switching between 'search' and 'text' based on editable state.

## Use Case

This component is ideal for situations where users need to choose from a large list of options but are likely to know what they're looking for. For instance, selecting a product code from a large catalog, or choosing a user from a massive user base, where typing to filter is much faster than scrolling through options.

## Important Notes

- The component transitions the input field between editable and read-only states. This behavior is essential for preserving UI consistency in different application contexts.
- Remember, this component uses custom events like `fireCustomEvent` from an imported module `c/nuUtils`. Ensure this module is available in your Salesforce org.
- Proper handling of the `readonly` attribute is crucial for accurate data representation and interaction with the component.
- The component's styling and behavior heavily rely on the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS), ensuring a consistent look and feel with the Salesforce experience.
