### Description

The Lightning component `NuChatWithAccountManager` provides a live chat interface within Salesforce, enabling users to send and receive messages in real time. Styled with Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS), it facilitates initiating a chat, displaying chat messages between the user and account manager, and sending new messages.

### Methods

- **connectedCallback:** Initializes the component by subscribing to the chat channel.
- **disconnectedCallback:** Cleans up the component by unsubscribing from the chat channel before it's destroyed.
- **closeChat:** Closes the current chat session and updates the record to reflect that the chat is closed.
- **handleSubscribe:** Subscribes to a Platform Event to listen for incoming chat messages.
- **handleUnsubscribe:** Unsubscribes from the Platform Event to stop receiving chat messages.
- **handleInputChange:** Handles changes to the input field for new messages, updating the local `newMessageBody` property.
- **sendMessage:** Sends a new chat message by creating a `Chat_Message__c` record.
- **pubsishEvent:** Publishes a Platform Event to notify other subscribers about the new chat message.
- **messageReceived:** Callback for when a new chat message is received, triggering a refresh of chat messages.

### Properties

### Use Case

This component can be used in a community or within internal Salesforce org to facilitate real-time communication between account managers and customers or internal users. It supports sending and receiving text messages, displaying them in a conversational UI, and provides functionalities like closing the chat and real-time notifications for new messages.

### Important Notes

1. **Security:** Ensure that Platform Events and CRUD/FLS (Field-Level Security) permissions are properly set up for access to required fields and objects like `Chat__c` and `Chat_Message__c`.

2. **Subscription to Platform Events:** The component subscribes to a Platform Event (`New_Chat_Message__e`) to receive real-time updates. Ensure the named Platform Event exists in the org.

3. **Apex Controllers:** Several server-side behaviors such as fetching chat messages, publishing new chat message events, and sending emails are handled by Apex controllers (`nuService_Contact`). Ensure these Apex controllers are properly defined and accessible by the component.

4. **Styling with SLDS:** The component makes extensive use of SLDS for styling. Modification to these styles should adhere to SLDS guidelines to ensure consistent UX within Salesforce.

5. **Component Cleanup:** The component properly handles lifecycle hooks to subscribe and unsubscribe from Platform Events, crucial for avoiding memory leaks or unnecessary API calls when the component is not in use.
