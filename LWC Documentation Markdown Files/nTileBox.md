### Description

The Salesforce Lightning component `NTileBox` presents a customizable, scrollable tile container for displaying a list of tiles. The tiles are represented by another custom component `c-n-square-tile`, and can be horizontally scrolled if enabled. The component is designed to encapsulate a responsive design approach, adapting its appearance and functionalities based on screen width and whether scrolling is enabled.

### Methods

- **handleSideScroll(e):** This method implements the behavior for scrolling tiles to the left or right within the container, based on the user holding down the mouse button over the respective scroll icon (`utility:chevronleft` for left, `utility:chevronright` for right). It uses a set interval to continue scrolling as long as the mouse button is held down.

```javascript
handleSideScroll(e){
    let direction = e.target.getAttribute('data-scrollbtn') === 'right' ? 20 : -20;
    let elem = this.template.querySelector('.tile-container');
    this.mouseInterval = setInterval(() => {
        elem.scrollLeft += direction;
    }, 25);
}
```

- **handleStopSideScroll():** This method stops the scrolling action initiated by `handleSideScroll` by clearing the interval set by the latter. It is called when the mouse button is released or the mouse leaves the scroll icon.

```javascript
handleStopSideScroll(){
    clearInterval(this.mouseInterval);
}
```

### Properties

- **tileArray (@api):** An array of objects where each object represents data for a tile to be displayed.
- **boxLabel (@api):** A string representing a label displayed at the top of the tile box.
- **scrollable (@api):** A Boolean indicating if the tile container should allow horizontal scrolling.
- **notificationArr (@api):** An optional array passed to tiles, presumably for displaying notifications.
- **tileBoxStyle (@api):** A string for inline CSS style to customize the tile box's appearance.
- **isUtility (@api):** A Boolean to indicate if the tile box is being used as a utility component, affecting tile visibility.

### Use Case

The `NTileBox` component is ideal for scenarios requiring a visually appealing and interactive method to display a collection of related items or actions. For instance, representing a series of projects, contacts, or tasks in an application dashboard, where users can quickly navigate through the collection. Its responsive and scrollable features ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

### Important Notes

- The component dynamically checks if there are any tiles to display through the `hasTiles` getter, making it versatile for dynamic data loading scenarios.
- The responsiveness is handled via CSS, particularly the `.tile-container` class, which changes its layout based on the `scrollable` property and screen size.
- Due to the component being highly customizable through its API properties, thorough testing is recommended to ensure its behavior aligns with the intended use case, especially for dynamic data loading and styling.
