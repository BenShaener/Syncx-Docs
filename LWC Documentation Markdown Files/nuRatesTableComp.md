### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuRatesTableComp` is designed to manage and display rate-related information within a Salesforce environment, specifically designed for the Rate Management System. The component utilizes a lightning-card layout to display a table (`c-nu-rates-table`, a custom component) populated with records fetched from an Apex class, allows for inline editing of records, and includes functionalities to add, update, and delete rate records. It also features dynamic picklist fields based on schema information and showcases the use of various Lightning Data Service and Apex method invocations to manipulate and display data relevant to "Rates".

### Methods

- **handleAddNewRow:** Adds a new empty rate row to the table, allowing users to input new rate information.

- **handleCellChange:** Triggers when cell data in any row is edited, updating the draft values state to reflect changes made.

- **handleSave:** Saves all changes made in the draft to the backend. This involves separating records that need to be inserted from those that need to be updated, making respective `createRecord` and `updateRecord` calls, and handling deletion requests for removed records.

- **handleCancel:** Reverts changes made by resetting the data in the table to the last saved state and clears any draft values.

- **updateDataValues:** Helper method to update the component's data with changes made by the user. It's used internally to synchronize the component's state with user actions.

- **updateDraftValues:** Updates draft values based on inline editing, handling special conditions for rate class and rates class selections.

- **showToast:** Utility method to display toast notifications for success or error messages.

- **refresh:** Refreshes the table data after a save operation, ensuring the displayed data is up-to-date.

- **pollFunction:** An internal function used by the `refresh` method to periodically check if data needs to be updated from the server.

### Properties

- **data:** Stores the current rates to be displayed in the table.
- **draftValues:** Tracks changes made by the user to the data before saving.
- **pickListOptions, typeOptions:** Stores picklist options for 'Rate Class' and 'Rate Type' fields.
- **showSpinner:** A boolean to control the display of a loading spinner during data operations.

### Use Case

This component could be utilized in a Salesforce org where managing rate information is crucial, for example, in a financial services application where rates are frequently updated and need to be reflected across various parts of the system in real-time. Users can view, add, edit, or delete rate records directly within a user-friendly interface without navigating away from the page.

### Important Notes

1. **Custom Apex Calls:** The component relies on custom Apex methods like `fetchRates` to retrieve rate information. Proper setup and access to these methods are crucial for the component to function as expected.

2. **Dynamic Picklist Values:** The component dynamically fetches and assigns picklist values for 'Rate Type' and 'Rate Class' from the Rate object fields, which requires the setup of these fields in the org where the component is deployed.

3. **Inline Editing and Data Management:** The component handles inline editing and manages draft states for potentially complex data manipulation before saving. This ensures a smooth user experience but requires careful handling of data states to prevent unsaved data loss.

4. **LDS and Refresh Strategy:** Leveraging Lightning Data Service (LDS) functionalities like `updateRecord`, `createRecord`, and `refreshApex` for data operations, the component ensures data consistency across the Salesforce UI without manual refreshes, utilizing an asynchronous polling mechanism to refresh data post-save.

5. **CSS Styling:** The `.cardSpinner` CSS class applied to the lightning-card element positions the loading spinner. Ensure this styling does not conflict with other CSS in the Salesforce org where the component is deployed.
