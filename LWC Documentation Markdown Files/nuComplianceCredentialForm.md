### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuComplianceCredentialForm` is designed for managing compliance documentation associated with placements in a Salesforce org. It operates within the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) framework, providing a user interface for adding, editing, and viewing compliance documents, credentials, and requirements. The component incorporates modals for interacting with different forms, such as starting a compliance document type form, adding a new document type, or creating a new compliance requirement.

### Methods

The component includes several JavaScript methods to handle user interactions and backend communication, including:

- `renderedCallback`: Initializes the component by either setting default values or loading existing information based on the provided `recordFormId`.
- `handleSaveClick`: Handles the "Save" action for the compliance document being edited or created.
- `handleFormOnload`, `handleNewComplianceRequirementSuccess`, `handleNewCredentialSuccess`, `handleFormSuccess`: Methods to handle the successful submission of forms within the component.
- `openNewCredentialModal`, `closeNewCredentialModal`, `openNewComplianceRequirementModal`, `closeNewComplianceRequirementModal`: Methods to open or close modals for adding new credentials or compliance requirements.
- `previewHandler`: Navigates to a URL to preview documents related to the compliance credentials.
- `handleUploadCredentialFinished`, `handleReuploadCredentialFinished`, `handleUploadFinished`, `handleReuploadFinished`: Handle the completion of file upload or re-upload processes.
- `handleCredChange`: Manages changes to the credential input field, updating component state as needed.

### Properties

Key properties (decorated with `@api` or `@track`) include:
- `recordFormId`: The ID of the record currently being viewed or edited.
- `instructions`, `specifyMode`, `selectedPlacement`, `selectedStatus`, `selectedStage`: Various metadata and configurations influencing the form's behavior and appearance.
- `filesResult`, `credentialValue`, `reqValue`, `ccValues`: Track state related to file uploads and field values within the forms.
- `credObject`, `reqObject`: Schemas for the `Credential__c` and `Compliance_Requirement__c` objects used in forms.
- `showNewCredentialForm`, `showStartlForm`, `showNewComplianceRequirementForm`: Control the visibility of different forms within the component.

### Use Case

The component's primary use is within Salesforce orgs that manage compliance documentation related to placements. Use cases include:
- Adding new compliance credentials to a placement.
- Editing existing compliance documents or credentials.
- Viewing compliance requirements and uploading necessary documentation.

### Important Notes

- This component relies on external Apex controllers (`nuController_CredentialsChecklist`) for backend operations such as fetching applications and handling document uploads.
- Custom utility methods, such as `fireToast`, are utilized for displaying messages to the user.
- Several commented code segments indicate areas for potential extension or modification, such as enabling additional form fields or handling different file types.
- The component's behavior is significantly dynamic, relying on the current state and user input to determine which forms to display and how to process submissions.

### Code Samples

The following sample shows how a new credential form is toggled on and off within the component using JavaScript methods:

```javascript
openNewCredentialModal(event) {
    this.showNewCredentialForm = true;
    this.showStartlForm = false;
}
```

```javascript
closeNewCredentialModal(event) {
    this.showNewCredentialForm = false;
    this.showStartlForm = true;
}
```

These two methods control the display of the "New Credential" form by toggling the `showNewCredentialForm` and `showStartlForm` Boolean properties.
