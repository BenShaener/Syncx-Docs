### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuCandidateCredentialsZIP` is designed to manage and interact with candidate credentials. It provides functionalities such as selecting files, viewing individual files, and downloading selected files either individually or as a ZIP. The component utilizes Apex controllers for backend data retrieval and supports navigation for file viewing and downloading.

### Methods

- **selectAll**: Toggles the selection of all credentials in the list based on the user input. It updates the list of selected credentials accordingly.
  
- **handleFileSelect**: Manages the selection state of individual files. Adds or removes the selected file's identifier from the internal list depending on the checkbox's state.
  
- **viewFile**: Navigates the user to the URL of the selected file, allowing the user to view it.
  
- **downloadZIP**: Constructs a URL for downloading all selected files as a ZIP and navigates the user to that URL. It first checks if at least one file is selected.
  
- **downloadSingle**: Constructs a URL for downloading a single selected file and navigates the user to that URL.

### Properties

- **recordId** (`@api`): The Id of the record the component is associated with. This is an API property allowing it to be set externally.
  
- **candidateCredentials** (`@track`): Tracked property holding the list of candidate credentials fetched from the backend.
  
- **selectedCredentials**: Internal property holding the list of credentials selected by the user for downloading.

### Use Case

This component can be utilized in scenarios where managing candidate credentials is necessary. Typical use cases include:
- Allowing users to select multiple credentials from a list and download them as a ZIP file for easier handling.
- Providing functionality to view or download individual files for closer inspection or specific needs.
- Dynamically loading and displaying credentials based on the associated record, making it adaptable to various contexts like a hiring audit or placement compliance check.

### Important Notes

- The component makes use of Salesforce Apex controllers named `nuController_RelatedLists` for backend operations like fetching the name of the object by record Id and retrieving candidate credentials. Ensure these controllers are properly defined and accessible.
  
- It leverages the `lightning/navigation` service for navigating to URLs for viewing or downloading files, hence requires proper URL constructions for these actions to work as expected.
  
- The visibility of certain elements, like the "Download ZIP" button or individual "Download" buttons, is controlled based on whether an object name is available or not, highlighting the component's adaptability to different object contexts within Salesforce. 

- The `@salesforce/schema` import comment signifies a potential use case where you might want to import specific schema elements, such as fields from a `Hiring_Audit__c` object. This is commented out in the provided code but indicates possible extension points for future customization.

### CSS 

The component does not include specific CSS code, but it utilizes Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes extensively to ensure a consistent look and feel with the Salesforce Lightning Experience.

### XML 

The component's configuration file (`*.xml`) is not provided, but it's essential to define tags like `<isExposed>`, `<targets>`, and possibly `<targetConfigs>` within this file to control where and how the component can be used within the Salesforce environment.
