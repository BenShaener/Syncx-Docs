### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuExpenseView` is designed to display and manage expense records in a Salesforce Community environment. It features a complex UI that includes tabs for different expense statuses (Unapproved, Approved, and Rejected), with each tab containing a dynamic list of expenses. The component allows users to filter expenses by candidates and specialties, view detailed expense information, approve, reject, and resubmit expenses.

### Methods

1. **approveExpenseAsync:** Approves an expense based on the given expense ID, user name, and approver ID.
   
2. **rejectExpenseAsync:** Rejects an expense with the provided reason, based on the given expense ID, user name, and approver ID.
   
3. **filterExpense:** Filters the displayed expenses based on user inputs, such as candidate and specialty filters, and date range.
   
4. **handleViewFile:** Handles the event to view the attached file for an expense.
   
5. **handleAttachmentsClick:** Opens the page or modal to attach files to an expense.
   
6. **handleViewExpense:** Handles the event to view details of a rejected expense for potential resubmission.
   
7. **handleSectionToggle:** Toggles the visibility of sections in the accordion UI element when a section header is clicked.

### Properties

- **expenses:** A getter that returns the list of expenses.
- **showApproveAll:** Determines whether the "Approve All" button should be shown based on the number of submitted expenses.
- **timesheetOptions:** Retrieves and formats options for selecting a timesheet.
- **showsOnWREXPENSE:** Determines if the work record expenses feature should be shown.
- **openModal:** Tracks the state of the modal for inputting a rejection reason.

### Use Case

This component is used in Salesforce Communities to allow users (such as managers or approvers) to view, filter, approve, reject, or resubmit expense records. It's designed to handle different states of expenses, provide a user-friendly interface for managing them, and offer functionalities like file attachment viewing and expense filtering.

### Important Notes

1. **Communication with APEX:** The component relies on methods (`approveExpense`, `rejectExpense`, `fetchExpensesForAgencyContact`, `fetchContactId`, `fetchSingleExpense`) from APEX classes to perform CRUD operations on expense records. Ensure these APEX methods are correctly defined and accessible.

2. **NavigationMixin:** The component uses `NavigationMixin` for navigation purposes, such as redirecting to a file attachment page or opening a resubmission form. Ensure import and usage follow Salesforce best practices.

3. **Accessibility:** Attention should be paid to making the UI accessible, including proper labeling, keyboard navigation, and ARIA attributes where applicable.

4. **Performance:** Given the potentially large set of expense records and dynamic data binding, consider implications on performance and user experience, such as loading times and responsiveness of filters.

5. **Community Compatibility:** Ensure the component and its features are fully compatible with Salesforce Community Cloud, considering permissions, visibility, and user roles.
