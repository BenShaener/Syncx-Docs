### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `OrdersToApprove` is designed for Salesforce Lightning Experience. The component retrieves and displays a list of job orders that require approval. It shows these orders in a `lightning-datatable` with pagination, using an infinite loading strategy to load additional data on demand. The component also demonstrates the use of conditional rendering, dynamic styles based on fetched data, Apex methods to fetch data from Salesforce, and integration with custom styles and utilities.

### Methods

1. **connectedCallback()**
   - Triggered when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initiates the fetching of contactId, accountId, and related theme styles or custom styles. It also starts the process to fetch the initial set of job orders to approve.
   
2. **renderedCallback()**
   - Called after every render of the component. It ensures data loading continues as needed after the initial render.
   
3. **loadMoreData(event)**
   - Triggered by an event such as scrolling or explicitly by code attempting to load more orders. It fetches the next set of job orders based on the current offset and updates the data table.

### Properties

1. **@api testOriginalActorId**
   - Optional. Allows for testing the component with a specified Salesforce actor ID.
   
2. **@api testContactId**
   - Optional. Allows for setting a test contact ID, circumventing the initial fetch from the user context.
   
3. **@track contactId**
   - The ID of the contact linked to the current user.
   
4. **@track accountId**
   - The ID of the account associated with the contact.
   
5. **@track wiresLoaded**
   - A flag indicating whether initial data has been loaded.
   
6. **columns**
   - Defines the structure and type of columns shown in the `lightning-datatable`.
   
7. **ordersToApprove**
   - Holds the set of job orders loaded for approval.
   
8. **recordCount**
   - Tracks the number of records currently displayed.
   
9. **totalNumberOfRows**
   - The total count of job orders available for approval.
   
10. **loadMoreStatus**
    - Textual status indicating the loading state of additional records.

### Use Case

A typical use case for this component might be in a Salesforce org where job orders are managed and require approval processes. A user such as a manager or an admin can use this component to review, sort, and approve job orders directly from a custom Salesforce page or application. The component provides an efficient way to manage large sets of data by loading them incrementally as the user scrolls through the list.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the Apex classes `nuService_Contact` and `nuService_nuJobOrder` are accessible and have the appropriate `@AuraEnabled` methods needed by this component.
- The datatable uses `enable-infinite-loading` and a custom offset management strategy to handle large sets of data without loading everything at once, improving performance.
- Dynamic styling based on the account's configuration or default styles demonstrates how to tailor the UI programmatically.
- This component relies on external utilities and styles (e.g., `getPageStyles` from `c/nuUtils`, and styles from `c/nuCSS`) which need to be defined and available in your org.
