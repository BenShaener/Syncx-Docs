### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `OrdersList` is designed to display a list of Job Order Releases related to an account within a Salesforce Community. It dynamically fetches and displays data using Apex controller methods. Key features include a loading spinner while data loads, a dynamic table for displaying releases, infinite loading of data, and custom styling based on account settings or global styles.

### Methods

- `connectedCallback()`: Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. It performs initial data fetching including user's contact ID, account details, and the first chunk of job order releases. It also sets custom styling based on account-specific theming or global styles.

- `renderedCallback()`: Lifecycle hook that runs after every render of the component. It's used to invoke `loadMoreData()` method on the first render to initiate the display and loading of job order releases data.

- `loadMoreData(event)`: This method is triggered when the user scrolls down the data table and more data needs to be loaded. It fetches the next set of job order releases and appends them to the current list, updating the table view.

### Properties

- `@api testAccountId`: (Public property) This is an externally assignable property used primarily for testing, allowing a specific account ID to be set.

- `@api title`: (Public property) Allows the setting of a title for the page or the table from the component's parent.

- `@track accountId`: (Private reactive property) Used to hold the ID of the account fetched based on the current user's contact ID.

- `@track wiresLoaded`: (Private reactive property) A boolean used to determine if initial data loading is complete to control the display of the loading spinner.

- `columns`: Defines the columns of the `lightning-datatable`. This is a static, pre-defined array that includes configurations for each column in the table.

- `releases`: Holds the array of job order release records fetched from Apex to be displayed in the table.

- `recordCount`: Tracks the number of job order release records currently displayed in the table.

- `loadMoreStatus`: Indicates the status of data loading, especially useful when implementing infinite loading to provide user feedback.

### Use Case

This component is particularly useful in a Salesforce Community where end-users need to view a list of Job Order Releases related to their account. Features like infinite loading and dynamic styling improve user experience by providing a seamless way to browse large datasets and a visually appealing interface that aligns with personalized or global design themes.

### Important Notes

- **Apex Controllers**: The component relies on multiple Apex controllers (`nuService_Contact` and `nuService_nuJobOrder`) for backend data retrieval. These controllers must be properly set up and accessible by the component.

- **Permission and Sharing Settings**: Ensure that the running user has the appropriate permissions to access the data being queried by the Apex methods.

- **Styling**: Custom styling is applied based on account-specific themes (if available) or global styles through the `getPageStyles` method. The CSS leverages an external stylesheet (`nuCSS`) imported at the beginning of the CSS file.

- **Data Table Configuration**: The `lightning-datatable` is configured to support infinite loading, with a fixed height that triggers loading more data as the user scrolls. Columns and data properties are dynamically set within the JavaScript file based on fetched data.

- **Error Handling**: While some basic structures for error handling and loading status updates are provided, consider implementing more comprehensive user feedback mechanisms for error states and exceptions.

- **Testing**: The component's dependency on external Apex controllers and potential custom styling based on account information makes thorough testing essential across different user profiles and data scenarios to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
