Additionally, it supports real-time chat functionalities and notifications, making it suitable for a dynamic, interactive user portal.

### Important Notes

1. **Adaptive Design:** The component contains responsive design properties enabling it to adapt between desktop and mobile views smoothly.
   
2. **Requires Apex Controllers:** The JavaScript controller references multiple Apex controller methods, such as `fetchContactById` and `getUsersChats`, which are necessary for fetching backend data.

3. **External ATS Link:** Offers an integration point with an external Applicant Tracking System via `handleMyATSClick`, enhancing the component's flexibility for recruitment-based applications.

4. **Unsaved Changes Handling:** The component is sensitive to unsaved changes, prompting the user before navigating away from the current page, ensuring data integrity and user confirmation before leaving the page.
