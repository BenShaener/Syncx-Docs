### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) `OrdersList` is designed to display a filtered list of job orders based on various criteria like status, work location, specialty, and priority. It employs a combination of imperative Apex methods to fetch data, child components for multi-select picklists, and lightning elements for data input and display. The component showcases dynamic styling based on fetched organization theme settings and provides interactive sorting and filtering functionalities on the displayed job orders list.

### Properties

- `@api testAccountId`: External Account ID that can be passed to the component for testing or specific data fetching.
- `@api status`: The initial status filter to apply to the job orders fetched.
- `@api title`: The title to display on the component, typically used to denote the type of data being presented.

### Methods

1. `connectedCallback()`: Lifecycle method that runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initializes data fetching operations and sets initial states.
2. `renderedCallback()`: Lifecycle method that runs after every render of the component. It is used for post-render operations or initialization that requires the DOM to be present.
3. `loadMoreData(event)`: Method attached to an infinite loading mechanism for the data table. It fetches additional data when the user scrolls to the bottom of the table.
4. `updateColumnSorting(event)`: Handles the logic for sorting data based on the selected column in the datatable.
5. `sortBy(field, reverse, primer)`: Utility method that returns a comparator function based on the field to sort by, whether it should be reversed and an optional primer function for preprocessing values.
6. `handleNameFilterChange(event)`, `handleStatusFilterChange(event)`, `handleSpecialtyFilterChange(event)`, `handlePriorityFilterChange(event)`, `handleCompanyFilterChange(event)`: Event handlers for filtering based on various fields. They update the internal state and trigger recalculation of the filtered dataset.
7. `doFilter()`: Applies all active filters to the job orders and updates the displayed data.

### Use Case

This component can be used in a Salesforce community or as part of an application where job orders need to be displayed, sorted, and filtered dynamically based on various criteria. It shows how to dynamically apply CSS styles, handle sorting and pagination in LWC, and utilize custom child components for enhanced input mechanisms like multi-select picklists.

### Important Notes

- The component makes extensive use of Salesforce Apex to fetch and manipulate data, tied closely to the schema of the Salesforce org it's deployed in. As such, the Apex class names and methods should exist and be accessible from the component.
- Custom child components (`c-nu-searchable-multi-picklist`) are used for multi-select filtering options. These components need to be defined and made compatible with the main component for it to function correctly.
- It leverages CSS from an external source or defined in another component (`c/nuCSS`) and conditionally applies styles based on the fetched account settings.
- The component also demonstrates a pattern for integrating Lightning Data Table with custom filtering and sorting functionalities that are not out-of-the-box features of the component.
- Data fetching and operations in `connectedCallback()` could potentially lead to lengthy operations and should be optimized or chunked for performance improvements, especially in large datasets. Error handling in Apex calls is present but minimal; for production use, consider adding more comprehensive feedback or retry mechanisms.
