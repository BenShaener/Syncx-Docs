### Description

The `NuQuickActionPresentCandidate` component for Salesforce Lightning is designed to facilitate the candidate presentation process within a hiring audit workflow. This component allows users to present candidates by showcasing their CVs, filling out a presentation form, and completing rate tables. It integrates with Salesforce's Apex controllers for backend operations such as checking existing CVs and attaching files to the provider. The component uses Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes to ensure a consistent and responsive UI.

### Properties

- **hiringAuditId:** Referenced ID for the hiring audit.
- **candidateId:** ID of the candidate being presented.
- **cvPreviewUrl:** URL to preview the candidateâ€™s CV.

### Use Case

It can be used as a quick action within Salesforce to streamline the candidate presentation process directly from Salesforce records related to hiring audits.

### Important Notes

- **SLDS:** The Salesforce Lightning Design System classes are used to maintain the styling consistent with the Salesforce Lightning Experience.
- **Apex Integration:** The component integrates closely with Apex controllers for back-end operations. Ensure the referenced Apex methods (`checkExistingCV`, `attachFilesToProvider`) are correctly implemented and accessible.
- **Refresh UI:** The component makes use of explicit UI refresh calls to ensure that UI state is consistent with the backend state after operations like file upload or record update.
- **NavigationMixin:** Used for navigating to web pages, like the CV preview URL. Pay attention to URL validity and access rights.
- **Event Handling:** Custom events are used to communicate between parent and child components (e.g., handling next button clicks or submitting forms). Proper event handling is crucial for the component's workflow.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that accessibility features such as labels and ARIA attributes are correctly implemented for a broader user acceptance.
