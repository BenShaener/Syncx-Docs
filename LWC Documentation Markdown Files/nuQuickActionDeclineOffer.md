### Description

The `NuQuickActionDeclineOffer` Lightning Web Component (LWC) provides a modal pop-up interface for users to input a reason for declining an offer. The component dynamically adjusts which field to update based on whether the offer is declined by an agency or a client and supports the inclusion of a comment when the specified reason is "Other (require comments)."

### Methods

- `connectedCallback`: Initializes the component by determining the correct field to update based on the context (agency or client). This method is invoked after the component is inserted into the DOM.
  
- `handleInputChange`: Captures and logs changes to the reject reason text area. This method handles input change events for the rejection reason comment.
  
- `handleFieldChange`: Monitors changes to the decline reason selection field and determines if the comment section should be shown based on the selected reason.
  
- `closePopupSuccess`: Validates the input field values and updates the related Hiring Audit record with the decline reason and optional comment. It also posts a toast message based on the operation's outcome before closing the modal.
  
- `closePopup`: Closes the modal without saving changes by dispatching a custom `finishquickaction` event.

### Properties

- `@api hiringAuditId`: The ID of the Hiring Audit record being updated.
  
- `@api isDeclineOfferByAgency`: A boolean indicating if the decline operation is initiated by an agency.
  
- `@api isDeclineOfferByClient`: A boolean indicating if the decline operation is initiated by a client.
  
- `@track showSpinner`: Used to control the display of a spinner, indicating a process is taking place.
  
- `@track showCommentRequire`: Indicates whether the comment input should be displayed based on the selected decline reason.

### Use Case

This component is intended to be used in scenarios where a user needs to document the reason for declining a hiring offer in a Salesforce community. It adapts to different contexts (agency or client-initiated decline) and enforces input validation, ensuring that a reason and, where necessary, an accompanying comment are provided before submission.

### Important Notes

- Users should ensure that the `@salesforce/schema` fields utilized (`Status__c`, `Presentation_Decline_Reason__c`, and `Reason_for_Decline__c`) exist and their API names are correctly referenced.
  
- It leverages the `updateRecord` method from `lightning/uiRecordApi` for seamless integration with Salesforce's data layer.
  
- The component employs custom toast notifications (`fireToast` utility) for user feedback, which suggests that there's a dependency on another LWC (`c/nuUtils`) for displaying these messages. Ensure this utility is included in your Salesforce org.
  
- The modal utilizes SLDS classes and attributes to align with Salesforce Lightning Design System standards for consistent styling and accessibility.

### Example Use

```html
<c-nu-quick-action-decline-offer
  hiring-audit-id={someHiringAuditId}
  is-decline-offer-by-agency={trueOrFalse}
  is-decline-offer-by-client={!trueOrFalse}>
</c-nu-quick-action-decline-offer>
```

**Note:** Replace `{someHiringAuditId}` with the actual ID of the Hiring Audit record and `{trueOrFalse}` with appropriate boolean values based on the context.
