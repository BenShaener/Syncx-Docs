### Description
This Apex class provides functionality for the forgot password flow in Salesforce Lightning Experience, allowing users to reset their passwords and set a specific Experience Cloud site experience ID. It includes methods to initiate the forgot password process by generating a reset password link for the user and setting an Experience Cloud site's experience ID based on a given identifier. 

### Methods

- **forgotPassword(String username, String checkEmailUrl)**: This method attempts to send a password reset email to the user specified by the `username`. It constructs a redirect to the `checkEmailUrl` if the username is valid. If the operation succeeds, the method returns `null`; otherwise, it returns an error message.

    ```java
    @AuraEnabled
    public static String forgotPassword(String username, String checkEmailUrl)
    ```

- **setExperienceId(String expId)**: Sets the experience ID for the current Experience Cloud site session to the specified `expId`. Returns `null` if the ID was successfully set or an error message if an exception occurs.

    ```java
    @AuraEnabled
    global static String setExperienceId(String expId)
    ```

### Properties
N/A

### Use Case
This class is useful when customizing the user experience for the forgot password flow within Salesforce Lightning Experience or Salesforce Experience Cloud sites. It allows developers to integrate a custom forgot password functionality into their Lightning components or Experience Cloud site pages, providing a tailored experience for users resetting their passwords. Additionally, it supports setting an experience ID dynamically, enabling more personalized site experiences based on the user's context or other criteria.

### Important Notes
- The `forgotPassword` method relies on `Site.forgotPassword` to send the reset email, which means it is essential to have properly configured email templates and Salesforce settings to support password reset functionality.
- The call to `Site.setExperienceId` within `setExperienceId` method enables the association of a specific Experience Cloud site experience with the current user session, which can impact content rendering and user experience based on the set ID. Care should be taken to ensure the correct ID is passed to this method to avoid unintended site behavior.
- Error handling in both methods ensures that any exceptions are caught and the error message is returned to the caller, facilitating troubleshooting and user feedback in the UI.
- The use of `@AuraEnabled` annotations on methods makes them accessible from Aura and Lightning Web Components, enabling seamless integration with Salesforce's Lightning Experience.
