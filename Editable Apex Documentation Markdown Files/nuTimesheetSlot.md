**Description:**  
This class represents a model for a timesheet slot specific to an employee within an organization. It stores information regarding a specific timeslot including details about time entries, shifts, breaks, hours, and additional notes. This class is designed to be used in Salesforce environments, particularly with Aura and Lightning Web Components, to facilitate the management of timesheets in a user-friendly manner.

**Methods:**  
This class does not contain any methods. It primarily serves as a data structure with properties to be accessed and modified directly.

**Properties:**
- **slotId:** Unique identifier for the timeslot.
- **employeeId:** Identifier for the employee associated with this timeslot.
- **placementId:** Identifier indicating the placement or position associated with the timeslot.
- **timesheetId:** Identifier for the timesheet this slot belongs to.
- **entryId:** Unique identifier for the entry within the timeslot.
- **slotName:** Name or title of the slot.
- **slotDay:** The day of the week for this slot.
- **slotDate:** The specific date for this slot.
- **shift, inTime, outTime:** Details about the shift times.
- **shiftStart, shiftEnd:** Specific start and end times for the shift.
- **inDate, outDate:** Dates for clocking in and out, useful for overnight shifts.
- **multiDay:** Boolean indicating if the shift spans multiple days.
- **clockInClockOut:** Boolean indicating if the slot uses clock in and out times.
- **unpaidBreak:** Duration of any unpaid break periods in decimal hours.
- **hours:** Total hours worked in the slot.
- **note, shiftNote:** Textual notes for the slot and specific shift respectively.
- **overTimeRule:** Indicator of the overtime rule applicable to this slot.
- **computeAutoBreak:** Boolean indicating if breaks should be automatically computed.
- **readonly:** Boolean indicating if the slot is readonly.
- **allowDelete:** Boolean indicating if the slot can be deleted.
- **customProperties:** A list of custom properties associated with the slot, allowing for extensibility.

**Use Case:**  
This class is ideal for managing employee timesheets in a Salesforce application. It can be used by HR departments or team leads to track work hours, shifts, breaks, and overtime for payroll and attendance purposes. The structure is readily usable in Aura Components or Lightning Web Components, making it easy to integrate into custom Salesforce applications for time tracking and management.

**Important Notes:**
- This class is marked as `public without sharing` which means it does not enforce sharing rules. It's important to manually handle data access permissions especially when dealing with sensitive employee-related data.
- Since all properties are marked with `@AuraEnabled`, they can be directly accessed from Lightning components. However, best practices around data validation and error handling should be followed to maintain data integrity and application security.
- The use of `List<nuCustomProperty>` for `customProperties` indicates this class's flexibility in handling various data types and extending functionality without modifying the core structure.
