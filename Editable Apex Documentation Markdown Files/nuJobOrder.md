### Description

This class is designed to encapsulate information related to job orders in a Salesforce environment. It acts as a data model with various properties representing different attributes of a job order, such as its ID, name, status, company name, and many others. Each property within this class is made accessible for Lightning components through the `@AuraEnabled` annotation, enabling these components to display and manipulate job order data within the Salesforce Lightning Experience.

### Methods

This class does not contain any explicit methods beyond the implicit getter and setter methods that are automatically available for each property due to the `@AuraEnabled` annotation and the `{get; set;}` accessors defined for each property.

### Properties

- `jobOrderId`: A string representing the unique identifier of the job order.
- `jobOrderName`: The name of the job order.
- `status`: The current status of the job order.
- `jobOrderUrl`: The URL for accessing the job order details.
- `companyName`: The name of the company associated with the job order.
- `specialty`: The specialty area of the job order.
- `workLocation`: The location where the work for the job order is to be carried out.
- `description`: A textual description of the job order.
- `startDate`: The start date of the job order.
- `endDate`: The end date of the job order.
- `companyApproved`: A boolean indicating whether the job order has been approved by the company.
- `synchronizeApproved`: A boolean indicating whether the job order is approved for synchronization.
- `daysOpen`: The number of days the job order has been open.
- `numberOfSubmissions`: The number of submissions made for the job order.
- `priority`: The priority level of the job order.
- `availableAgencies`: The agencies available for the job order.

### Use Case

This class can be used in a Salesforce Lightning component that requires detailed information about job orders for display, editing, or reporting purposes. For instance, a custom Lightning component on a Salesforce page could use instances of this class to display a list of job orders with their details or allow a user to edit the details of a job order directly from the Salesforce UI.

### Important Notes

1. All properties are exposed to Aura and Lightning Web Components, meaning any changes to these property names or types need to be carefully managed to avoid breaking existing components.
2. While this class structures the data for job orders, implementing logic such as validation, calculation of days open, or any business-specific rules would require additional methods or triggers not defined within this class.
3. The use of the `with sharing` keyword means that access to job order records is restricted based on the current user's permissions and sharing settings, which is crucial for maintaining data security and visibility according to Salesforce's sharing rules.
