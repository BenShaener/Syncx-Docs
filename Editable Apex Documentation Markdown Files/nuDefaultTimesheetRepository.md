The provided code does not directly display an implementation for the specific feature of "autofilling a placement on update" in a straightforward manner. However, throughout the extensive code provided, various methods, such as creation, update, deletion, and fetching related to `nuTimesheet`, `nuExpense`, and related entities, are handled. 

To implement a feature like autofilling a placement on update, you would generally capture the event of an update (potentially through triggers or invocable methods if dealing with asynchronous processes or using Salesforce Flows), and within that context, you could automate the process of filling in or updating the related `placement` fields based on your business rules.

Given the complexity of your implementation and the absence of a direct snippet related to autofilling placements on update, I'd recommend creating a specific method or trigger logic that listens to updates on the relevant objects (`nuTimesheet`, `nuTimesheet_Entry__c`, etc.) and performs the necessary logic to autofill or update the placement based on the most up-to-date information available or according to the specific rules you set forth for your process.

For example, in an Apex trigger for `nuTimesheet` or affiliated object, you might:

1. Detect changes that require updating the placement.
2. Fetch or calculate the new placement information as required.
3. Apply these changes to the object in context and perform the update.

Note: Direct modification within triggers should be approached with caution to avoid recursive updates and to maintain bulk operation safety. Utilizing helper classes and having a robust framework for handling bulk data operations are considered best practices.

Without more specific details on the business logic and the exact implementation requirements for the "autofill on update" feature, this general approach should serve as a guideline for integrating such functionality into your existing codebase.
