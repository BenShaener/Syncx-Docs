### Description

This class offers functionality to handle notifications and email communications triggered by changes in the `Chat__c` custom object, notably when a `Chat__c` record's `Account_Manager__c` field value changes. It utilizes Salesforce's Messaging and CustomNotification classes to send notifications and emails to relevant users.

### Methods

- `handleChatNotifications(List<Chat__c> newList, Map<Id, Chat__c> oldMap)`: This method identifies `Chat__c` records that have undergone a change in their `Account_Manager__c` field, prepares notifications and emails for those changes, and sends them out to the appropriate users and queues.

- `private static buildEmailForChat(String subject, String body, String target)`: A helper method that constructs a `Messaging.SingleEmailMessage` instance with specified subject, body, and target recipient. It configures the message to use a specific `OrgWideEmailAddress` and to be saved as an activity.

### Properties

- `notificationType`: A static `CustomNotificationType` record queried by developer name ('Sync_Notification') used in custom notifications.

- `owa`: An `OrgWideEmailAddress` record (queried by `DisplayName` 'Syncx') to be used as the sender address for outgoing emails.

### Use Case

This helper class can be invoked within trigger handlers for the `Chat__c` custom object to manage notifications and communications related to re-assignment of chat records. It ensures that when a `Chat__c` record's assigned account manager changes, a set of predefined users and queues receive both a custom notification and an email summarizing the re-assignment.

### Important Notes

- The `handleChatNotifications` method assumes that changes have occurred and compares new values against old ones to detect changes in the `Account_Manager__c` field. This is typically used within a trigger's `after update` event.

- This class does not handle bulk email limitations or Custom Notification limits; it is assumed that volume will be managed upstream or that limits will not be reached.

- The method directly sends out emails and notifications, without batch processing or scheduling, which could lead to limit exceptions in high-volume contexts.

- Error handling in `handleChatNotifications` is minimal, primarily logging exceptions to the debug log instead of more robust error management or user notification strategies.
