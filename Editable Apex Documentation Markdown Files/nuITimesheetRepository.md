**Description:**  
This interface defines the operations related to timesheets, expenses, and slots management in a timesheet application. It provides methods for fetching, saving, submitting, approving, and rejecting timesheets and expenses, along with managing timesheet slots and expenses for both agency and approver contacts. It also involves adjustments like computing overtime and handling events related to slots.

- `String fetchContact(Id contactId)`: Fetches the contact information based on the provided contact ID.
- `nuTimesheetCollection fetchTimesheetsForContact(...)`: Returns a collection of timesheets for a given contact filtered by status, start date, and end date.
- `list<nuExpense> fetchExpensesForAgencyContact(...)`: Fetches expenses for an agency contact filtered by status and date range.
- `list<nuExpense> fetchExpensesForApproverContact(...)`: Retrieves expenses for an approver contact filtered similarly.
- `List<nuClassificationTableBuild> fetchExpensesForEmployees(...)`: Gets expenses for employees based on their contract type and date range.

- `nuServiceResult deleteSlot(...)`, `saveSlot(nuTimesheetSlot slot)`, `saveAllTimeSlot(...)`: Manage the deletion and saving of timesheet slots.

- `List<nuTimesheet_Entry_Slot__c> setHoursOnInsert(...)`, `setRate(...)`: Sets hours and rates on timesheet entry slots.
- `map<id,decimal> getExpenseAmounts(Id contactId)`: Gets expense amounts for a given contact.
  
**Properties:**  
Not specifically applicable as this is an interface and properties are typically not defined within interfaces in Apex.

**Use Case:**  
Implement this interface for any class that needs to manage timesheets, expenses, and slots in a Salesforce application. Such implementation can support activities in an organization where tracking work hours, expenses, and their approvals are critical. For instance, a custom Salesforce application for project management or HR operations could use an implemented version of this interface to streamline processes around timesheets and expenses.

**Important Notes:**
- Implementing classes must provide concrete implementations for all the interface methods to adhere to the contract defined by the interface.
- Consider transaction control, error handling, and governor limits when implementing these methods in the Salesforce context.
- Security permissions on objects and fields should be carefully managed, especially for methods that access or modify sensitive information like contact details, timesheets, and financial data.
