### Description

This documentation outlines a test class for the `MergeDateTimeInvocable` Apex class, specifically targeting its functionality to combine date and time elements from separate sources into a single `DateTime` object. The test case provided within ensures that the `createDateTime` method of `MergeDateTimeInvocable` correctly merges a date from a `DateTime` object with the time from a `Task` object's custom time field.

### Methods

- `testCreateDateTime()`: This test method performs the following actions:
  - Creates a `Task` record with a specified follow-up time.
  - Populates a list of `MergeDateTimeInvocable.Wrapper` instances with the `Task` record's ID and a future date.
  - Invokes the `createDateTime` method of `MergeDateTimeInvocable` with the prepared list.
  - Asserts that the result is a list containing a single `DateTime` object, which correctly represents the combined date and time.

### Properties

No properties are directly defined or used within this test class other than local variables within the `testCreateDateTime` method for setup and assertion purposes.

### Use Case

The primary use case for this test class is to validate the functionality of the `MergeDateTimeInvocable` class's `createDateTime` method. It ensures that when provided with a date and a time from different sources, the method can accurately merge these into a single `DateTime` object, reflecting the correct year, month, day, hour, minute, and second as specified in the test setup. This validation is crucial for processes that depend on accurately scheduling or recording events based on dynamically generated dates and times.

### Important Notes

- The test class uses hard-coded values for both the date and time parts, which means it specifically tests the merging capability for a predetermined point in time (May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM). To thoroughly ensure the robustness of the `MergeDateTimeInvocable.createDateTime` functionality, additional tests with varying dates and times might be necessary.
- As a best practice, the test method is encapsulated within `Test.startTest()` and `Test.stopTest()` calls to ensure that governor limits are properly reset during the test's execution and that any asynchronous operations can complete before assertions are made.
- The use of `System.assertEquals()` extensively in the assertions helps ensure that each component of the resulting `DateTime` object (year, month, day, hour, minute, second) matches the expected values individually, providing a granular level of testing accuracy for the `createDateTime` method's output.
