### Description
This class defines a model for handling hiring audit records in Salesforce, particularly designed to interface with Aura components. It encapsulates candidate and job order details along with metadata about the hiring process such as the current stage, status, and associated account and placement information.

### Methods
There are no custom methods defined in this class; it solely consists of properties marked with the `@AuraEnabled` annotation to make them accessible from Aura components (Lightning Components).

### Properties
- `hiringAuditId`: Unique identifier for the hiring audit record.
- `Ids`: A general-purpose identifier field, possibly used to store multiple IDs in a concatenated format.
- `accountId`: Identifier for the associated account record.
- `candidateName`: The name of the candidate.
- `jobOrder`: Identifier for the job order related to the audit.
- `jobOrderName`: The name of the job order associated with the audit.
- `currentStage`: The current stage of the hiring process for this candidate.
- `status`: The status of the hiring audit.
- `agencyName`: The name of the hiring agency involved, if any.
- `clientContactName`: Name of the contact person at the client's side.
- `createdDate`: The date and time when the hiring audit record was created.
- `placementName`: The name of the placement associated with the hiring audit.
- `placementId`: Unique identifier for the associated placement record.
- `specialty`: The specialty area of the job or candidate.
- `classificationFromAssignment`: The job classification derived from assignment details.
- `classification`: The classification of the job or candidate.
- `location`: The location associated with the job order or candidate.
- `candidatePhone`: The candidate's phone number.
- `candidateMobile`: The candidate's mobile phone number.
- `candidateEmail`: The candidate's email address.
- `candidateType`: The type/category of the candidate.
- `accountManager`: The account manager responsible for the hiring audit.

### Use Case
This class can be used in the context of Lightning Experience or Salesforce Mobile App to dynamically display and update hiring audit information on custom Aura components. For instance, it could be part of a component designed to showcase detailed audit trails of candidate placements and job orders managed by a staffing agency. This setup allows for real-time tracking of candidates' hiring process stages and effective communication between recruiters, candidates, and clients.

### Important Notes
- All properties are accessible from Aura components, thanks to the `@AuraEnabled` annotations. This means any changes to these property names or types will require updates to the associated Aura components.
- This class has no methods, which implies it's mainly used for data transfer between the Salesforce server and Aura components. It acts as a structured data packet rather than containing business logic.
- Consider implementing data validation and access control either in this class or in the Aura components that utilize it to maintain data integrity and security compliance.
- Given the nature of this class, it's likely part of a larger system dealing with candidate management and hiring workflows, suggesting dependencies on other Salesforce objects and classes.
