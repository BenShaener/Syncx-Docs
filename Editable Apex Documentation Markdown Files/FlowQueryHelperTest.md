### Description
This class is dedicated to testing the functionality of the `FlowQueryHelper` utility, particularly focusing on its ability to fetch records based on a collection of IDs. The class contains a single test method `testGetRecordsInCollection` which verifies the method `getRecordsInCollection` of the `FlowQueryHelper`.

### Methods

- `testGetRecordsInCollection()`: This is a static method annotated with `@IsTest`, indicating it's a test method for Salesforce. It performs the following actions:
  - Initializes custom settings required for the test.
  - Uses a helper class `testdataFactory` to create test accounts with predefined properties.
  - Prepares input for the `FlowQueryHelper.getRecordsInCollection` method by setting up a list of account IDs.
  - Invokes the `FlowQueryHelper.getRecordsInCollection` method and passes the necessary input.
  - Asserts the expected size of the output list and the number of records returned in the output.

### Properties
There are no properties directly defined within this test class. However, it makes use of external properties such as `Account_Auto_Number__c` from a custom setting, and leverages record type ID retrieval through the `Schema` class.

### Use Case
The primary use case of this test class is to ensure that the `FlowQueryHelper.getRecordsInCollection` method correctly retrieves Salesforce records (in this context, `Account` records) based on a specified list of record IDs. It validates that the method returns the correct number of output records, matching the input criteria.

### Important Notes

- This test method employs the `testdataFactory` class to create test data. The `testdataFactory` class should be predefined and designed to generate test records for various sObjects efficiently.
- It uses a hard-coded Record Type Name (`Agency`) to fetch the Record Type ID. In a dynamic environment, the existence of this Record Type should be ensured.
- It makes use of custom settings (`NUCSH__c`) which might require specific setup or values before running the test.
- The method asserts the expected results using `System.assertEquals` to ensure the functionality under test behaves as expected under the defined test conditions.
- Being an `@IsTest`, this class does not consume Salesforce org's SOQL query limits or DML statement limits during its execution.
