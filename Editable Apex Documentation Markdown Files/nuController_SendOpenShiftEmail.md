### Description

A class designed to send scheduled event email notifications for open shifts to recruiting and scheduling contacts within an organization. It targets contacts associated with placements that match the specialty, provider type, and work location of the specified scheduled event.

### Methods

- `sendOpenScheduledEventEmail(List<Scheduled_Event__c> eventList)`: A static method to trigger the process of sending emails. It takes a list of one or more `Scheduled_Event__c` objects, although it currently processes only the first object in the list.

### Properties

- The class doesn't explicitly define properties, but it interacts with:
    - `Scheduled_Event__c` objects to get details about the event.
    - `nuPlacement__c` objects to find matching contacts based on the event's specifics.

### Use Case

To utilize this class effectively:
1. Compile a list of `Scheduled_Event__c` objects that represent the events for which you want to send notifications.
2. Call the `sendOpenScheduledEventEmail` method with this list as its argument.

Example:
```java
List<Scheduled_Event__c> eventList = new List<Scheduled_Event__c>{/* Populate the list with relevant events */};
nuController_SendOpenShiftEmail.sendOpenScheduledEventEmail(eventList);
```
This is particularly useful in scenarios where an organization needs to automatically notify relevant contacts of open shifts, facilitating a quicker staffing process.

### Important Notes

- Currently, the method processes only the first `Scheduled_Event__c` object in the provided list. If multiple event notifications are needed, the method would have to be called separately for each event.
- The email template and OrgWideEmailAddress are hard-coded to specific values (`Syncx_Open_Shift` and 'Syncx' respectively), which means they need to be present and correctly set up in the Salesforce org for emails to be sent.
- The email sending process checks for duplicates in the `storeEmailList` to prevent sending multiple emails to the same contact but due to a bug, it mistakenly adds `Agency_Recruiting_Contact__r.Email` twice when it should add `Agency_Scheduling_Contact__r.Email` for the second check. This might result in unintended behavior.
- The method uses SOQL queries to retrieve data, which might need to be optimized or bulkified for handling larger datasets to avoid Salesforce governor limits.
