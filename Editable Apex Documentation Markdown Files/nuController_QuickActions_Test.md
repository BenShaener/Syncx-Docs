### Description

This class is designed for unit testing the `nuController_QuickActions` class, specifically focusing on the functionality around submitting candidates through quick actions in Salesforce. It tests the core functionality to ensure the system behaves as expected when a candidate is submitted for a job order by a specified agency.

### Methods

- `makeData()`: This is a `@TestSetup` method that prepares necessary test data before the tests are run. It creates custom settings, an account for a client, an account for an agency, a job order linked to the client, and a candidate (as a contact with a specific record type). This method aims to replicate a realistic scenario where these elements are required to test the submission of a candidate.

- `testSubmitCandidateQuickAction()`: This method specifically tests the `submitCandidate` method in the `nuController_QuickActions` class. It retrieves a candidate ID, a job order ID, and an agency ID from the previously created test data and calls the `submitCandidate` method using these IDs. The main purpose is to ensure this action can be performed without throwing any exceptions, indicating that the candidate submission process works as expected.

### Properties

There are no explicit properties defined within this test class. However, it uses IDs from created test records as variables within the `testSubmitCandidateQuickAction` method to facilitate testing.

### Use Case

This test class is intended to be used by developers and QA engineers who are working on verifying that the quick action for submitting candidates in a recruitment system functions correctly. It is particularly useful in scenarios where new features or bug fixes related to candidate submission are being introduced into the system. By running this test, developers can quickly ascertain whether their changes have adversely affected the ability to submit candidates for job orders by agencies.

### Important Notes

- The test class makes use of a separate factory class (`nuMockFactory`) for the creation of test data. This indicates that there is a dependency on this factory class being correctly implemented for the test to function as expected.
  
- The `testSubmitCandidateQuickAction` method is wrapped in a `try-catch` block but does not include any assertions or specific error handling within the `catch` block. This could potentially mask failures, making the test pass even when there is an issue with the `submitCandidate` method.

- The use of `@TestSetup` for creating test data is efficient as it reduces the setup time for each test method that runs within this class. However, it's essential to ensure that the setup data aligns closely with real-world scenarios to make the tests meaningful.

- This class assumes the existence of a record type named 'Candidate' for the Contact object and specific fields on custom settings and custom objects like `NUCSH__c` and `Job_Order__c`. These dependencies should be noted when setting up the test environment or when changes are made to the org's schema.
