**Description:**
This class is designed to represent a collection of timesheets, along with an associated update date. It is primarily intended for use in Lightning components, as indicated by the `@AuraEnabled` annotation. The class operates without enforcing sharing rules, ensuring it can access all relevant timesheets regardless of the user's data access permissions.

**Methods:**
This class does not define any custom methods beyond the automatically provided getter and setter methods that are generated for the `updatedDate` and `timesheets` properties due to their public access level and the use of `{get; set;}` syntax.

**Properties:**
1. `updatedDate`: An `@AuraEnabled` property of type `DateTime` that stores the date and time when the timesheet collection was last updated. This allows front-end components to display or use the last updated timestamp of the timesheet data.
   
   ```java
   public DateTime updatedDate {get; set;}
   ```

2. `timesheets`: An `@AuraEnabled` property that holds a list of `nuTimesheet` objects. This property enables the passing of a collection of timesheets between the Apex backend and the Lightning front end, facilitating the display, manipulation, or analysis of timesheet data in a user interface.
   
   ```java
   public List<nuTimesheet> timesheets {get; set;}
   ```

**Use Case:**
This class is particularly useful in scenarios where an application or module within Salesforce requires handling multiple timesheet entries as a unified dataset, especially in contexts involving user interfaces created with Aura or Lightning Web Components. For example, it could be used to fetch a batch of timesheet entries for display in a custom Lightning component, providing users with an overview of time entries and allowing for interactive updates or analyses.

**Important Notes:**
- The class is declared as `without sharing`, meaning it does not automatically enforce the sharing rules of the current user context. This is important to consider in terms of data security and visibility; depending on the use case, it might expose sensitive data to users who should not have access to it.
- Both properties are annotated with `@AuraEnabled`, making them accessible from Lightning components. This is crucial for any front-end logic that needs to interact with timesheet data or display the last updated timestamp.
- The `timesheets` property anticipates a collection of `nuTimesheet` objects, assuming `nuTimesheet` is a custom class or entity that needs to be defined elsewhere in the codebase. The design and behavior of `nuTimesheet` would significantly affect how this class is used.
