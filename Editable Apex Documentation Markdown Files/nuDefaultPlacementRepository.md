### Description
This Apex class provides functionality for managing and accessing placement records in Salesforce. It implements the `nuIPlacementRepository` interface, allowing for operations such as fetching placement details, saving placement information, and retrieving placements based on specific criteria such as provider start dates.

### Methods
- `fetchPlacement(Id placementId)`: Retrieves a single placement record based on the specified ID.
  
- `fetchPlacements(Set<Id> placementsIds)`: Fetches multiple placement records based on a set of placement IDs.

- `savePlacement(nuPlacement placement)`: Saves or updates placement information in Salesforce.

- `fetchPlacementsWhereProviderStartingSevenDays(Id agencyId, Id worklocationId)`: Fetches placement records where the provider is starting within the next seven days, filtered by agency or work location.

- `fetchPlacementsWhereProviderStartingTenDays(Id agencyId, Id worklocationId)`: Fetches placement records where the provider is starting within the next ten days, with additional filtering options similar to the seven-day method.

### Properties
This class does not explicitly define public properties. It operates primarily through its methods to handle data related to `nuPlacement__c` objects and associated records.

### Use Case
This class can be utilized in scenarios where there is a need to manage and access placement information within a Salesforce application. It is particularly useful for:
- Displaying placement details.
- Updating placement records with new hours worked, compliance, or enrollment information.
- Retrieving a list of placements that meet specific criteria, such as starting within a certain period or being associated with a particular agency or location.

### Important Notes
- This class utilizes SOQL queries to retrieve placement records and related information from Salesforce. It is important to be mindful of governor limits when performing these operations, especially when fetching large sets of data.
- The class uses custom DTO (Data Transfer Object) patterns for handling complex data structures. Understanding these patterns is crucial for working effectively with this class.
- The `savePlacement` method uses the Database class to handle DML operations, which can provide partial success in batch operations. This needs careful error handling and rollback mechanisms in place to ensure data integrity.
- This class does not share its data with other classes (`without sharing` keyword), meaning it disregards the user's permissions regarding record visibility. This choice should be made with security implications in mind, ensuring it aligns with the application's requirements.
