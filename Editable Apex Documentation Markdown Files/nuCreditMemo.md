**Description:**  
This class is designed to model a credit memo, encapsulating related information such as its name, the associated amount, and linked records including a worklog and an invoice. Each field within the class is made accessible in Lightning components via the @AuraEnabled annotation, allowing for seamless UI integration and manipulation within Salesforce Lightning Experience.

**Methods:**  
There are no explicit methods defined within this class. The primary functionality revolves around the access and mutation of its properties through getters and setters, which are implicitly provided by the Apex language for the public properties.

**Properties:**

- `creditMemoId`: Represents the unique identifier for the credit memo. Type: Id
- `creditMemoName`: Stores the name of the credit memo. Type: String
- `amount`: Holds the monetary amount associated with the credit memo. Type: Decimal
- `worklogId`: The unique identifier for a linked worklog. Type: Id
- `worklogName`: The name of the associated worklog. Type: String
- `invoiceId`: Stores the unique identifier of the linked invoice. Type: Id
- `invoiceName`: Holds the name of the associated invoice. Type: String

**Use Case:**  
This class can be utilized in a Salesforce Lightning component that requires displaying or editing details of a credit memo. It could be used in a form-based UI where sales representatives need to create or update credit memos, including information about related worklogs and invoices. For example, a Lightning web component could bind to these properties to show a detailed view of a credit memo or to form a new credit memo entry.

**Important Notes:**  

- The `@AuraEnabled` annotation is crucial for the integration with Lightning Experience, making these properties accessible for Lightning components.
- This class does not include methods for data persistence (such as saving to a database); instead, it is likely intended to be used alongside other Apex controllers or service classes that handle data retrieval and persistence.
- Developers should ensure proper access control and sharing settings are in place when utilizing this class in Salesforce, as it involves access to potentially sensitive financial information.
- Validation logic (e.g., making sure the amount is positive) is not present within this class and should be handled elsewhere in the application.
