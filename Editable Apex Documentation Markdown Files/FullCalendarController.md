### Description

This controller class provides functionality for managing calendar events within a Salesforce application, especially focused on interacting with the FullCalendar JS library. It allows the querying of events within a specific time range from different Salesforce objects dynamically, saving new or updated events with multiple fields and relationships, and removing events. This class is designed to be used in Salesforce Lightning Components through `@AuraEnabled` methods to allow easy AJAX calls.

### Methods

- **getEventsNearbyDynamic:** Queries events within a given date range from a dynamic Salesforce object and returns a list of these events. 
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static List<Object> getEventsNearbyDynamic(Date startDate, Date endDate, ...)
  ```
- **saveEvent:** Saves or updates a calendar event with multiple parameters including IDs for related records, event details like title and time, and optional auto-selection of billing rates.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static nuServiceResult saveEvent(String eventId, String whoId, ...)
  ```
- **removeEvent:** Deletes a specified event by its ID.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static boolean removeEvent(string id)
  ```
- **setBillRate:** A helper method to set the billing rate for an event based on the eventâ€™s start and end time compared to rates available. Not exposed externally as it is a private method.
  ```java
  private static void setBillRate(List<Rate__c> billRates, Scheduled_Event__c evt)
  ```

### Properties

This class does not define specific properties but operates heavily on parameters passed to its methods, manipulating Salesforce records based on those parameters.

### Use Case

A common use case for this class is in a Salesforce Lightning Component that acts as an interface for scheduling and managing events, possibly in a healthcare context where provider shifts, specialties, and rates may play a role in scheduling. It could be used to display a calendar of events (appointments, meetings, etc.) and enable the creation, update, and deletion of these events with complex business logic behind scenes.

### Important Notes

- The class does not implement sharing rules (`without sharing` keyword), meaning it runs in system context and has access to all objects and fields irrespective of the user's permission set. This should be cautiously considered in terms of data security and visibility.
- The `nuServiceResult` referenced in `saveEvent` method seems to be a custom class designed to handle the results of DML operations, including success data and error messages. This class must be defined elsewhere in the application.
- The `Scheduled_Event__c`, `Rate__c`, `Account`, and potential other custom objects or fields mentioned need to be predefined in the Salesforce org for the code to function.
- The dynamic SOQL query in `getEventsNearbyDynamic` combined with string concatenation poses a risk of injection if not properly handled. Although Salesforce automatically escapes strings in bind expressions, care should be taken to sanitize user inputs.
- The heavy reliance on strings for field names and SOQL queries increases the risk of typos and maintenance challenges, making it important to carefully manage schema changes in the org.
