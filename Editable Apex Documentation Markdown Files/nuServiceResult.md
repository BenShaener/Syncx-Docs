### Description
A class designed to encapsulate the results returned from a service call within Salesforce Lightning components. This class holds both the data retrieved from the service call (if successful) and any error information if the call fails. This dual-purpose structure makes it easier to handle the results of asynchronous operations in the Salesforce Lightning context, where data and error handling are both crucial. The class is marked with `without sharing`, indicating it doesn't enforce record-level access permissions, which should be considered when dealing with sensitive data.

### Methods
This class does not explicitly define any methods. However, it utilizes automatically generated getter and setter methods for its properties due to the `@AuraEnabled` annotation. This allows these properties to be accessed in Lightning components.

### Properties
- `data (object)`: This property is intended to store the result data from a service call. It is exposed to Lightning components, allowing for easy data binding and manipulation within the UI layer.
  
- `error (object)`: Similar to the `data` property, this property is intended to hold any error information that might have resulted from the service call. It can be utilized to convey error details to the user through the UI.

### Use Case
A typical use case for this class is within a Lightning Web Component (LWC) or Aura component that makes a server-side call to fetch data. Upon completion of the call, the resulting data or error information is encapsulated within an instance of this class and returned to the calling component. The component can then conditionally render the UI elements based on the presence of data or error in the returned `nuServiceResult` object. This pattern enhances error handling and data representation in user interfaces.

```java
nuServiceResult result = new nuServiceResult();
result.data = fetchData(); // Assume fetchData() is a method that fetches data
result.error = null; // No error in this case
```

### Important Notes
- The use of `public without sharing` may have implications on data security and visibility, as it will not automatically respect the organization's sharing rules. This should be carefully considered, especially when designing components that handle sensitive or confidential information.
- The properties in this class are marked with `@AuraEnabled`, making them accessible from Lightning components. However, it is essential to ensure that any sensitive data handled by the class is appropriately secured and that permissions are correctly managed in the component itself.
- While this class provides a straightforward way to encapsulate service call results, developers should ensure that error information is detailed enough to enable effective debugging and user communication without exposing sensitive system details.
