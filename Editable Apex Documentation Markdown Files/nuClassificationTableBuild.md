**Description:**  
This class is designed to model and encapsulate detailed information about an employee classification, including their name, department (and its code), hours worked, amount earned, and their average rate of pay. The class is marked as `without sharing` ensuring that it does not enforce sharing rules, thus it accesses data in the system mode.

**Methods:**  
No custom methods are defined within this class. It relies on system-generated getters and setters due to the `@AuraEnabled` annotation on its properties.

**Properties:**  
- `employeeName` (String): Stores the name of the employee.  
- `det` (String): Stores the name of the department the employee belongs to.  
- `detCode` (String): Stores the code of the department the employee belongs to.  
- `hours` (Decimal): Represents the total hours worked by the employee.  
- `amount` (Decimal): Represents the total amount earned by the employee.  
- `avgRate` (Decimal): Represents the average rate of pay for the employee.

**Use Case:**  
This class is particularly useful in scenarios where an organization needs to build and display classification tables related to employee work statistics - including but not limited to department details, hours worked, and financial details such as earnings and rates. It could be utilized in custom Lightning components or Aura enabled methods that fetch and display this data on a Salesforce platform.

**Important Notes:**  
- The use of `@AuraEnabled` suggests the class properties are intended to be accessible from Lightning components or Aura calls, making it useful for UI development in Salesforce.
- The `without sharing` keyword indicates that data access within this class does not respect the organization's sharing rules. This should be considered carefully with respect to data security and visibility.
- It's important to initialize each property before use to prevent null pointer exceptions, especially when working with decimals and aggregated calculations.
- The class does not include any data validation, error handling, or custom logic for calculating fields such as `avgRate`, which might be necessary depending on the requirements.
- Enhancements could include adding methods for computation based on the provided properties to encapsulate more functionality within the class.
