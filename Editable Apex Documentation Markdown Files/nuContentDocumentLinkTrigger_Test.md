### Description
A test class designed to validate the creation of a `ContentDocumentLink` by associating a `ContentVersion` with a specific Salesforce record. It leverages a mock factory, `nuMockFactory`, to create necessary test data including a `Contact`, a custom object `Credential__c`, and a `ContentVersion` that is related to the `Credential__c` record.

### Methods

- **createContentDocument():** A test method that verifies the creation of a `ContentVersion` related to a specific Salesforce record. It first creates a `Contact` and a `Credential__c` record using the `nuMockFactory` class. Then, it creates a `ContentVersion` that is associated with the `Credential__c` record. This method does not explicitly assert any outcomes but is designed to validate the mechanics of creating and linking content in Salesforce through a mock scenario.

### Properties
This class does not explicitly define any properties. It operates entirely through the use of local variables within the test method and the utilization of the `nuMockFactory`.

### Use Case
- **Developers and Test Engineers:** Primarily, this class serves as a foundational block for developers and QA engineers who are involved in developing and testing functionalities around `ContentDocumentLink` creation and association with records in Salesforce. By ensuring that `ContentVersion` can be correctly linked to other records (in this case, a `Credential__c` record), developers can be more confident that related functionalities in the application will perform as expected in a production environment.

### Important Notes
- The class uses a mock factory (`nuMockFactory`) to generate necessary records for the test. This approach helps in maintaining clean test data and allows for more controlled testing scenarios.
- There are no explicit assertions within the test method, meaning this test primarily validates that the operation does not throw exceptions rather than checking for specific outcomes. It's recommended to include assert statements in test methods to verify that the state of the application or database matches expected outcomes.
- The test class is defined with `@isTest` annotation, ensuring that it does not consume Salesforce org limits and is only available within the test execution context.
- The use of `with sharing` keyword in the test class definition does not impact its execution in the test context since test methods run in system mode, bypassing record-level access rules. However, it is good practice to match the sharing model of the code being tested.
