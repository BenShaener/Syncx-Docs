### Description
This class provides utility methods for fetching `Rate__c` records associated with different Salesforce objects such as Job Orders, Rate Tables, Hiring Audits, and Assignments. It allows users to query for rates based on specific criteria including job order ID, rate table ID, hiring audit ID, and assignment ID.

### Methods
- **fetchRates(Id rateTableId)**: Fetches a list of `Rate__c` records associated with a specific rate table ID.
  
- **fetchRatesFromHiringAudit(Id hiringAuditId)**: Fetches a list of active `Rate__c` records linked to a particular hiring audit ID.
  
- **fetchRatesFromHiringAudit(list<Job_Order__c> joInput)**: Fetches rate tables that match specified Job Order criteria, including specialties and credentials. Returns a nested list of `Rate_Table__c` matching the input.
  
- **fetchRatesFromJobOrder(Id jobOrderId)**: Retrieves a list of active `Rate__c` records connected to a given job order ID.
  
- **fetchRatesFromAssignment(Id assignId)**: Gathers a list of `Rate__c` records tied to a specific assignment ID.

### Properties
Not applicable as this class primarily consists of static methods without class-level properties.

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful in scenarios where there is a need to programmatically extract rate information based on varying context such as job orders, hiring audits, or specific assignments within Salesforce. It can be particularly advantageous in payroll and billing automation processes where dynamic fetching of rates based on specific criteria is necessary.

### Important Notes
- The `fetchRatesFromHiringAudit(list<Job_Order__c> joInput)` method is marked with `@invocableMethod`, making it accessible for use within Salesforce's process builder or flow. It accepts a list but currently processes only the first `Job_Order__c` record from the input list, potentially ignoring subsequent records if the list contains more than one element.
- The methods contain queries that potentially return a large set of data. It's important to be mindful of governor limits regarding query rows and heap size when invoking these methods.
- All methods have a safeguard for fetching records where `Call_Rate__c` is null. This could be a specific business logic requirement indicating that only records without an explicitly set call rate are considered valid for these operations.
- Some methods ensure that only active rates (`Is_Active__c = true`) are fetched from the database, which is crucial for applications where only currently applicable rates should be considered.
