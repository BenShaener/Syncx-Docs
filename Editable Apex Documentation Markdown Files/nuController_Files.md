### Description
This Apex controller `nuController_Files` is designed to handle file and expense-related operations for a Salesforce org. It serves as a bridge between the UI layer, typically Aura or Lightning Web Components, and the back-end, handling interactions with `ContentDocument`, `nuExpense__c`, and other related sObjects. It leverages the `nuGateway_Files` and `nuGateway_Contact` utility classes to perform CRUD operations and retrieve specific data related to files, expenses, styling settings, and more.

### Properties
No specific properties outside method parameters are declared or used directly within this class.

### Use Case
This controller is ideally suited for applications within Salesforce that require extensive file and expense management capabilities, especially in scenarios involving document upload/download, expense tracking, and report generation. It can be utilized within both Aura and Lightning Web Components to provide users with seamless interactions with file and expense records, enhancing the overall user experience in financial or document management applications.

### Important Notes
- The `@AuraEnabled` annotation is pivotal for exposing these methods to the Aura and Lightning Web Components, making sure they are accessible from the client side.
- The use of `cacheable=true` on some methods indicates that the results are intended to be cached for performance benefits, especially in read-heavy operations like fetching settings or attachments.
- This class operates without sharing mode (`public without sharing class`), which means it does not enforce the sharing rules of the current user. This is crucial for use cases where the application needs to access records regardless of the user's permissions, but developers should be mindful of the security implications.
- Transactions and operations assumed to be handled within the `nuGateway_Files` and `nuGateway_Contact` classes are not explicitly detailed in this documentation, signifying a separation of concerns and a layered architecture approach.
