### Description
`CalendarController` is an Apex class designed to handle calendar events within a Salesforce environment. It primarily focuses on fetching a list of calendar events based on various parameters such as record ID and perspective, and allows for the integration of custom event source classes through dynamic Apex.

### Methods

1. **getEvents**
   ```java
   @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)
   public static List<CalendarEvent> getEvents(string recordId, string perspective, string eventSourceClassName)
   ```
   - Description: Retrieves a list of `CalendarEvent` objects based on the provided `recordId`, `perspective`, and a dynamic `eventSourceClassName` that specifies the custom class to use for fetching events. This method utilizes dynamic Apex to instantiate the custom class based on the class name provided.
   - Parameters:
     - `recordId`: A `String` representing the ID of the record for which events are to be fetched.
     - `perspective`: A `String` representing the perspective or context in which the events are being requested.
     - `eventSourceClassName`: A `String` containing the name of the custom class that implements the `IEventSource` interface for fetching events.
   - Return: Returns a `List<CalendarEvent>` containing the fetched events, or an empty list if the `eventSourceClassName` is `null`.

2. **justIncrement**
   ```java
   public static void justIncrement()
   ```
   - Description: This method serves as an example and performs no meaningful operation other than incrementing an integer variable a large number of times.
   - Note: This method does not have practical use within the context of the calendar events handling and may be present for demonstration or testing purposes.

### Properties
The `CalendarController` class does not explicitly declare any properties. 

### Use Case
A typical use case of the `CalendarController` class is within a Lightning Web Component (LWC) or Aura Component that requires displaying calendar events to the end user. Developers can call the `getEvents` method providing a custom class name that retrieves event data from various sources (e.g., Salesforce records, external APIs, etc.), and dynamically instantiate this class to fetch events based on the specific requirements of the application.

### Important Notes
- The `getEvents` method leverages the power of dynamic Apex through the `Type.forName` method to support custom event sourcing. This design allows for a flexible and extensible way to integrate various event sources without modifying the controller class.
- The custom class specified by `eventSourceClassName` must implement the `IEventSource` interface (not provided in the snippet) to ensure it conforms to the expected method signature for fetching events.
- The `justIncrement` method appears to serve no productive purpose and might be intended for debugging or instructional use. Its presence in production code should be re-evaluated.
