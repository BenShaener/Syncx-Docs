### Description
This class is designed to generate an Excel document for invoices including both summary and detailed data related to timesheets and expenses. It retrieves the current invoice details based on the provided invoice Id and aggregates related data from timesheets and expenses to populate the Excel document.

### Methods

- **GenerateInvoiceExcelDoc()**: Constructor method that initializes class properties, retrieves the invoice data based on `invoiceId`, and populates `summaryData` and `detailsData` with relevant information from related timesheets and expenses.
- **justIncrement()**: Static method that simply increments an integer variable multiple times to demonstrate increment logic. This method does not return any output nor does it contribute to the core functionality of the class related to generating invoice Excel documents.

### Properties

- **summaryData (List<ExcelSummary>)**: Stores summary information for the Excel document.
- **detailsData (List<ExcelDetails>)**: Contains detailed entries for the Excel document.
- **xmlheader (String)**: The XML header for the Excel document.
- **endfile (String)**: The closing tag for the Excel XML document.
- **invoiceDate (Date)**: Stores the date of the invoice.
- **invoiceNumber (String)**: Stores the invoice number.
- **invoiceType (String)**: Specifies the type of the invoice.
- **invoiceAgency (String)**: Specifies the agency related to the invoice.
- **invoiceFeeTotal (Decimal)**: Sum total of all fees associated with the invoice.
- **invoice (nuInvoice__c)**: Holds the invoice record from the query based on `invoiceId`.
- **invoiceId (Id)**: The ID of the invoice for which the Excel document is generated.

### Use Case
This class is specifically used in contexts where an automated generation of an Excel document for an invoice is required, including summarizing and detailing timesheet and expense information related to an invoice. It's suitable for finance and accounting applications within organizations that need to generate detailed reports for billing and invoicing purposes.

### Important Notes
- Initial data population for `summaryData` and `detailsData` occurs in the constructor, making it vital to provide an `invoiceId` through the current page parameters before instance creation.
- Every detail about the timesheets and expenses that are relevant to the invoice gets included, ensuring a comprehensive invoice report is prepared.
- While the `xmlheader` and `endfile` are prepared for an Excel document in XML format, the actual construction of the Excel file would require further processing of these XML strings along with the populated `summaryData` and `detailsData`.
- The `justIncrement` method serves as a placeholder for demonstrating logic flow and does not contribute directly to the functionality related to invoices.
