### Description

This class is designed to handle triggers related to `Contact` objects in Salesforce. It supports sending notifications and emails when new contacts are created, distinguishing between different types of contacts such as candidates, agency contacts, and client contacts based on their association with accounts and record types. The class leverages custom notifications, org-wide email settings, and conditional logic to target specific users and records.

### Methods

- `void fetchContactForNotifications(List<Contact> newContacts, Map<Id, Contact> oldMap)`: Processes a list of newly created or updated contacts to send custom notifications and emails based on their categorization (agency contacts, client contacts, or candidates). Uses `oldMap` to support logic that may depend on previous state, but primarily focuses on new contact processing in its current implementation.

### Properties

- `private static final CustomNotificationType notificationType`: Holds the metadata needed to send custom notifications, specifically the DeveloperName 'Sync_Notification'.
- `String CANDIDATE_RT`: Stores the RecordTypeId of the 'Candidate' record type for Contact.

### Use Case

This class is particularly useful in scenarios where an organization needs to automate communication both internally (via Salesforce notifications) and externally (via emails) when new contacts are added to their Salesforce instance. These could include but are not limited to:
- Notifying account managers when a new contact is associated with an account they manage.
- Letting agency users know when a new agency contact is created.
- Informing managers about new candidates being added, potentially for recruitment purposes.

### Important Notes

1. **Context-Specific Execution**: The method provided relies on being triggered after contacts are inserted or updated. It's crucial to ensure that this handler is invoked properly within a trigger context to function as intended.
2. **Customization Required**: The class appears to be tailored to specific org configurations, such as custom fields (`Agency__c`, `Account.Synchronized_Account_Manager__c`, etc.) and record types (`CANDIDATE_RT`, `AGENCY_ACC_RT`, etc.). Users need to ensure these configurations exist in their org or modify the code accordingly.
3. **Performance Consideration**: The method performs SOQL queries and DML operations within a loop, which can hit governor limits in Salesforce if not carefully managed. Future versions should consider bulkifying queries and operations where possible.
4. **Security and Sharing**: Marked as `without sharing`, the class does not enforce sharing rules. It's important to review the organization's security requirements to ensure this approach aligns with desired data access policies.
5. **Error Handling and Logging**: The method includes basic error handling for notification sending and attempts to log issues via `System.debug`. Enhancing error handling by incorporating more sophisticated logging or notification mechanisms might be beneficial for troubleshooting and monitoring.
