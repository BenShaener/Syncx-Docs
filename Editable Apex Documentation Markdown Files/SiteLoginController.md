**Description**

This class serves as a page controller for managing site login functionality within Salesforce. It primarily focuses on handling user login through a visual interface, linking front-end login components with backend authentication.

**Methods**

- `login()`: This method is responsible for authenticating a user against the Salesforce site's credentials. It leverages the `Site.login` method by passing in the username, password, and a start URL parameter which is fetched from the current page's URL parameters. It returns a `PageReference` object that can redirect the user to the desired page upon successful login.

```java
global PageReference login() {
    String startUrl = System.currentPageReference().getParameters().get('startURL');
    return Site.login(username, password, startUrl);
}
```

**Properties**

- `username`: A global access modifier property that holds the username entered by the user on the site login page.
- `password`: A global access modifier property that holds the password entered by the user on the site login page.

```java
global String username {get; set;}
global String password {get; set;}
```

**Use Case**

This class is intended to be used in custom Salesforce site pages where there is a need to authenticate users. It connects the login form fields (typically username and password) with Salesforce's backend authentication, providing a seamless login experience.

**Important Notes**

- This class is declared with `global` access, meaning it can be accessed across all namespaces. This is particularly useful for managed packages and when the class needs to be accessible from outside the salesforce org.
- The constructor is left empty, implying that no specific initialization is required for this controller. It serves mainly to facilitate the access to the `username` and `password` properties, along with the `login` method.
- The login functionality provided by this class relies entirely on Salesforce's built-in `Site.login` method, which simplifies the implementation of custom login logic.
