### Description
This class serves as a controller for the Provider Presentation PDF functionality in a Salesforce environment. It's designed to fetch and organize information related to a specific `Provider_Presentation__c` record, including related rates and dynamically gathering fields based on page layout metadata. It provides a mechanism to generate a PDF document for the provider presentation, managing existing document deletion, and new document creation with proper linkage to the given record.

### Methods
- **Constructor with StandardController parameter:** Initializes the controller with a standard controller object. This constructor is mainly used for extension scenarios.
    ```java
    public nuController_ProviderPresentationPDF(ApexPages.StandardController sdc)
    ```
- **Default constructor:** Prepares the controller by fetching the `recordId` from the page URL, querying for the `Provider_Presentation__c` record and its related `Rate__c` records. It also dynamically queries fields based on the layout metadata and formats a date related to the provider presentation.
    ```java
    public nuController_ProviderPresentationPDF()
    ```
- **generatePresentationPDF (static):** Generates a PDF document for the provider presentation, deletes an existing PDF if present, creates a new one, and returns a `nuServiceResult` object containing the URL to the newly created document or an error message.
    ```java
    @AuraEnabled
    public static nuServiceResult generatePresentationPDF(String recordId)
    ```

### Properties
- **sectionFieldsMap (Map\<String, List\<String>>):** Stores the mapping of section labels to their respective field labels, dynamically populated based on the page layout.
- **ratesList (List\<Rate__c>):** Holds the list of `Rate__c` records associated with the `Provider_Presentation__c` record.
- **presentation (Provider_Presentation__c):** Represents the `Provider_Presentation__c` record being worked with.
- **recordId (String):** Stores the Salesforce record ID of the `Provider_Presentation__c` record, fetched from the page URL.
- **formattedDate (String):** Contains a formatted version of the `When_Can_Provider_Start__c` date of the `Provider_Presentation__c` record.

### Use Case
This class is intended to be used in scenarios where a detailed PDF document needs to be generated for a Provider Presentation within Salesforce. It dynamically selects fields for display based on the page layout and includes related rate information. The PDF generation functionality can be triggered from the Salesforce UI, possibly through a button or link, which invokes `generatePresentationPDF`.

### Important Notes
- The dynamic retrieval of fields based on the page layout allows for flexible PDF content that adapts according to the current layout configuration.
- Prior to generating a new PDF document, existing documents titled 'Provider Presentation.pdf' linked to the specific record are deleted to ensure there's no duplication and the latest data is presented.
- The class does not handle permissions or sharing settings explicitly, operating under the assumption that the calling context has necessary access.
- Error handling in `generatePresentationPDF` ensures that issues in the PDF generation process are captured and relayed back to the calling context.
