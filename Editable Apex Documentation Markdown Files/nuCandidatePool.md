### Description

A class designed to represent a pool of candidates in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Mobile App. It serves as a data model for storing relevant candidate information like name, IDs, and contact details. The class is marked with `with sharing` to enforce record-level access permissions. 

### Methods

This class does not explicitly define any methods. However, it leverages the `@AuraEnabled` annotation to expose its properties to Lightning components, making them accessible for CRUD operations in a user interface context.

### Properties

- `name`: Represents the name of the candidate pool.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string name {get; set;}
  ```

- `Ids`: Stores a string representation of candidate IDs. It's expected to be used in situations where candidate identification is required in a text format.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string Ids {get; set;}
  ```

- `candidate`: A generic string property, presumably to store additional candidate-related information that is not covered by other properties.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string candidate {get; set;}
  ```

- `firstName`: Stores the first name of a candidate, facilitating a more personal interaction or communication.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string firstName {get; set;}
  ```

- `lastName`: Corresponds to the last name of a candidate, useful in formal communications and record keeping.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string lastName {get; set;}
  ```

- `email`: Contains the candidate's email address, essential for digital communication.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string email {get; set;}
  ```

### Use Case

This class can be utilized in the development of a custom Lightning component or Application in Salesforce, aimed at managing and displaying candidate information in a recruitment or HR module. Developers can easily bind these properties to component attributes and manipulate the candidate data for creating, reading, updating, or deleting operations within a user-friendly interface.

### Important Notes

- The use of the `@AuraEnabled` annotation means these properties can be directly accessed from Lightning components without the need of additional Apex methods for data retrieval or modification, streamlining the development process.
- The class is designed with simplicity and general utility in mind, which means it might require customization or extension to meet specific use-case demands or to adhere to best practices for handling sensitive information, like personal contact details in compliance with data protection laws.
- The `Ids` property, storing IDs as a concatenated string, might necessitate parsing or further manipulation to be useful in scenarios where individual ID values are required.
