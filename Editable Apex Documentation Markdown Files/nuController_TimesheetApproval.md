### Description
This class, `nuController_TimesheetApproval`, manages the approval process of timesheets in a system. It handles loading of the timesheet and its entries from the database based on a provided timesheet ID, displaying them for review, and processing their approval or rejection along with capturing necessary details like rejection reason, approverâ€™s name, and email. The class ensures that certain conditions are met before a timesheet can be successfully approved or rejected.

### Methods
- **nuController_TimesheetApproval()**: Constructor that initializes the class by loading a timesheet and its related entries based on the provided ID from the current page parameters.
- **getTimesheet()**: Returns the loaded `nuTimesheet__c` record.
- **getTimesheetTemp()**: Returns a temporary `nuTimesheet__c` record for manipulation within the class.
- **getEntryList()**: Returns a list of `nuTimesheet_Entry__c` records associated with the current timesheet.
- **save()**: Validates and saves the timesheet approval or rejection details. Displays appropriate messages for any missing information required for the process.

### Properties
- **message (String)**: Holds messages to be displayed to the user.
- **rejectionReason (String)**: Stores the reason for timesheet rejection.
- **approvedBy (String)**: Holds the name of the person who approved the timesheet.
- **approverEmail (String)**: Stores the email of the approver.
- **timesheetIdtemp (Id)**: Temporary storage for the current timesheet's Id.
- **timesheetId (Id)**: The ID of the timesheet being processed, retrieved from the page parameters.

### Use Case
This class is used in scenarios where a timesheet needs to be approved or rejected. It facilitates:
- The loading of timesheet details for review by an approver.
- Input and validation of approval or rejection criteria, including checking for mandatory fields.
- Saving the approver's decision along with additional context such as the reason for rejection.

### Important Notes
- The class operates without sharing, which means it does not enforce the sharing rules of the running user. This needs to be considered when dealing with sensitive or confidential data to ensure proper authorization is implemented externally.
- The constructor performs SOQL queries to load the timesheet and its entries, which may impact governor limits in Salesforce, especially in cases of bulk processing.
- The `save()` method updates the timesheet record with the approval details but contains commented out code that may be intended for future use or integration with other services like a payroll system.
- Use of `ApexPages.message` and `ApexPages.addmessage` methods within `save()` suggest this class is designed for use within a Visualforce page context for interactive feedback to the user.
