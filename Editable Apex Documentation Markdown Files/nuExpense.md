**Description:**

This Apex class is designed to manage expense-related data within a Salesforce environment. It is equipped with properties to store detailed information about individual expenses, including IDs, names, notes, types, amounts, and status details such as approval and rejection reasons. Key features include tracking of associated files (e.g., receipts), provider information, and various identifiers for integration with other processes or modules (e.g., timesheets). The class is annotated with `@AuraEnabled`, making its properties accessible for Salesforce Lightning components, which facilitates building dynamic UIs that interact with these properties.

**Methods:**

This class does not contain explicit methods beyond property getters and setters provided by Apex's implicit handling of the `@AuraEnabled` annotation. Each property with `@AuraEnabled` can be read (get) and written (set) by Lightning components or other Apex code that has access to instances of this class.

**Properties:**

- `expenseId`: Unique identifier for the expense.
- `expenseName`: Name or title of the expense.
- `resubNote`: Note provided upon resubmission.
- `timesheetId`: Associated timesheet identifier.
- `expenseType`: Category or type of the expense.
- `expenseAmount`: Monetary amount of the expense.
- `expenseNote`: Additional notes related to the expense.
- `receiptAttached`: Indicator whether a receipt is attached.
- `files`: Serialized string or identifier for associated files.
- `expenseDate`: Date the expense was incurred.
- `providerId`: Identifier for the provider of the service/goods.
- `providerName`: Name of the service/goods provider.
- `locationName`: Location where the expense was incurred.
- `status`: Current status of the expense (e.g., submitted, approved).
- `rejectedReason`: Reason provided for expense rejection.
- `approverName`: Name of the individual who approved the expense.
- `approvedDate`: Date when the expense was approved.

**Use Case:**

This class serves as a data model for managing expenses in Salesforce, ideal for use in custom expense management applications, integrations with financial systems, or to facilitate employee reimbursement processes. It can be used in conjunction with Lightning components to display, edit, and update expense records, making it a versatile tool for applications that require detailed expense tracking and management.

**Important Notes:**

- The class is marked as `public without sharing`, meaning it does not enforce record-level sharing rules. This could potentially expose sensitive expense information if not handled properly. It's important to assess and implement appropriate sharing settings based on the application's security requirements.
- Since the properties are annotated with `@AuraEnabled`, they can be directly exposed to and manipulated by Lightning components. Care should be taken to validate any data changes to protect against invalid or unauthorized expense record modifications.
- This class does not itself contain business logic to manage expense lifecycles or enforce validation rules. Such logic needs to be implemented separately, in accordance with the specific requirements of the expense management process it supports.
