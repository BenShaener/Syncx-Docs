### Description
This class, `nuGateway_Files_Test`, serves as a collection of test methods designed to test the functionality of the `nuGateway_Files` class, which presumably handles operations related to file management within a Salesforce environment. This includes creating, retrieving, and updating files associated with various records. It uses custom settings and a mock factory for creating test records, demonstrating how to set up a test environment that interacts with files and custom objects in Salesforce.

### Methods

1. **`getContactId_Test()`**: Validates the `getContactId` method of the `nuGateway_Files` class. It sets up necessary custom settings and then calls the method to test, ensuring no errors occur during its execution.

2. **`getFiles_Test()`**: Tests the `getFiles` method by setting up a test environment, including necessary custom settings and a mock record created by the `nuMockFactory`. It verifies the method's ability to retrieve files associated with a given record ID.

3. **`updateFiles_Test()`**: Focuses on testing the `updateFiles` method. It prepares the environment by inserting custom settings, creates a test record along with a content version to simulate a file, links this file to the test record, and finally, calls the `updateFiles` method to validate its functionality.

### Properties

This class primarily interacts with properties related to files in Salesforce, such as `ContentVersion`, `ContentDocument`, and custom settings through `NUCSH__c`. It manipulates these objects to test file management operations, like inserting and updating documents linked to specific records.

### Use Case

It is intended for use in the automated testing phase of the Salesforce development cycle, specifically for verifying the integrity and functionality of file-related operations in the `nuGateway_Files` class. By ensuring these methods work as expected in a controlled test environment, developers can prevent bugs and data integrity issues in production.

### Important Notes

- This test class requires an existing implementation of `nuMockFactory` and `nuGateway_Files` classes; without them, the tests will not execute.
- Custom settings (`NUCSH__c`) seem to be a critical part of the setup; hence, it's essential that they are correctly configured in both test and production environments.
- The tests make use of hard-coded values (e.g., setting `Account_Auto_Number__c` to 0), which may need adjustments based on the actual business logic and custom settings configurations.
- `updateFiles_Test()` employs DML operations on `ContentVersion`, `ContentDocumentLink`, and custom objects, showcasing a complex scenario of file and record linkage that mimics real-world use cases.
- These tests do not include any assertions to validate the effects of the `nuGateway_Files` methods' executions. It's crucial to include `System.assert`, `System.assertEquals`, or `System.assertNotEquals` methods to ensure the test validations are meaningful.
