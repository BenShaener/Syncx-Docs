### Description
`nuService_Calendar_Test` is a test class for the `nuService_Calendar` service, focusing on unit testing its methods responsible for various calendar event operations such as creation, modification, and querying of events and event claims within a Salesforce environment. It uses `nuMockFactory` for generating mock data.

### Methods

- `makeData()`: Sets up the test data for calendar events.
- `getEventsNearbyDynamic_Test()`: Tests the retrieval of events within a dynamic range.
- `createEventsFromJSON_Test()`: Tests creating events from a JSON payload.
- `saveEvent_Test()`: Tests saving (updating) an event with new details.
- `removeEvent_Test()`: Tests the removal of a specific event.
- `removeSelectShifts_Test()`: Tests the batch removal of selected shifts/events.
- `saveEventClaim_Test()`: Tests saving an event claim.
- `updateEventClaim_Test()`: Tests updating the status and notes of an event claim.
- `claimEventsFromJSON_Test()`: Tests claiming events for an agency or provider via JSON payload.
- `releaseSelectClaims_Test()`: Tests releasing (or unclaiming) selected claims.
- `selectEventClaimsFromJSON_Test()`: Tests selecting claims from events based on JSON input.
- `cancelSelectShifts_Test()`: Tests the cancellation of selected shifts/events.
- `confirmSelectShifts_Test()`: Tests the confirmation of selected shifts/events.
- `fetchPicklistValues_Test()`: Tests fetching picklist values from a specified field.

### Properties
Since this is a test class, it primarily interacts with properties of the `Scheduled_Event__c` and `Scheduled_Event_Claim__c` custom objects like `Id`, `Who__c`, `What__c`, etc., and the properties within the JSON payloads for creating and manipulating event data.

### Use Case
This test class is designed for developers or QA engineers who are implementing or verifying the functionality of the `nuService_Calendar` service. It helps ensure that all functionalities of the calendar service related to event and claim management work as expected after modifications or updates.

### Important Notes
- The `@TestSetup` method `makeData` initializes the testing environment with required records and relationships.
- Mock data for contacts, accounts, and events are created via `nuMockFactory`.
- Each test method wraps the call to the tested service method with `test.startTest()` and `test.stopTest()` to ensure governor limits are reset for the actual execution.
- Most tests involve interaction with custom objects `Scheduled_Event__c` and `Scheduled_Event_Claim__c` to simulate actual use cases of event and claim management.
- JSON payloads are used extensively for batch operations such as creating, claiming, and selecting event claims. The structure of these payloads is crucial for the correct execution of the service methods.
- The class is annotated with `@isTest` and uses data isolation to ensure that test records do not affect live data.
- Usage of Salesforce features like dynamic SOQL and DML operations, date handling, and handling of complex JSON structures are demonstrated across various tests.
