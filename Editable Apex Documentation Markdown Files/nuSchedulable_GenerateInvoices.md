### Description
This global class implements the Schedulable interface allowing it to be scheduled to run in Salesforce at specified times. Its primary purpose is to initiate a batch job that generates invoices based on the current date. 

### Methods

- **execute(SchedulableContext sc):** This method is the entry point for the scheduled job. When Salesforce executes the schedule, it calls this method, passing in a context object (`SchedulableContext sc`). Inside, it triggers the execution of a batch class (`nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices`) designed to generate invoices, setting the batch size to 1. This method ensures that the batch process starts, focusing on invoice generation based on today's date.

### Properties
- There are no explicit properties defined within this class as it primarily serves to implement the scheduling functionality.

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful for organizations that need to automate the generation of invoices based on daily transactions or events. By scheduling this class to run at a particular time each day, it ensures that all necessary invoices for the day are generated without manual intervention, improving efficiency and reducing the likelihood of human error.

### Important Notes
- The `execute` method currently has a commented-out line of code that seems to indicate the existence of another batchable class potentially intended for a different type of invoice generation (`nuBatchable_GenerateInvoices1099`). However, this line is not active in the current implementation.
- The batch size is explicitly set to 1 in the `executeBatch` method call. This is unusual for batch processes, as one of the primary benefits of batch processing is handling large volumes of data efficiently. Setting the batch size to 1 may significantly limit this efficiency and could result in higher resource consumption, especially if the volume of invoices to generate is large.
- As a global class, it can be accessed across namespace boundaries. This means that it is available not only within the Salesforce org in which it is defined but also from external packages. This level of access should be carefully considered to ensure it aligns with the intended use and security requirements of the organization.
