**Description**: The Apex class defined here is designed to represent a "release tier" entity, which could be relevant in systems managing release processes, job orders, or any context where a tiered approach to release or execution is applied. This entity seems to be tailored for use with Salesforce's Lightning Aura Components, as indicated by the `@AuraEnabled` annotations, enabling the properties to be accessible from the component's frontend.

**Methods**: This class does not explicitly define any methods beyond the implicit getters and setters provided by the `@AuraEnabled` annotation for each property.

**Properties**:
- `releaseTierId`: A unique identifier for the release tier. This is represented as a string, likely holding a Salesforce record ID or a similar construct. 
- `accountId`: Associated account identifier as a string. This suggests the release tier is linked to an account within the system.
- `releaseTierName`: A human-readable name for the release tier, allowing for easy identification and distinction from other tiers.
- `specialty`: A string representing the specialty or focus of this release tier. This could indicate the type of job orders or projects the tier is associated with.
- `daysBeforeJobOrderRelease`: A decimal value indicating the number of days before a job order is released. This property could be crucial for scheduling or planning purposes within the release process.

**Use Case**: A potential use case for this class could be in a Salesforce-based application that manages job orders or releases associated with different accounts. Each release tier could represent a level of service, urgency, or specialization that dictates how job orders are processed and scheduled. For example, in a marketing automation system, different release tiers could be used to manage the scheduling of campaign launches based on their importance, complexity, or associated account.

**Important Notes**:
- The class is marked `without sharing`, meaning it does not enforce the sharing rules of the running user. This is an important consideration for developers, as it means access control needs to be carefully managed elsewhere in the application, to avoid unintentional data exposure or privilege escalation.
- The properties are all marked with `@AuraEnabled`, indicating that they are intended to be accessed directly from Aura Components. Developers should ensure that only necessary data is exposed to the front end and that any sensitive information is properly handled.
- Given that the properties are public and tied to `@AuraEnabled`, this class is likely meant to serve as a simple data transfer object (DTO) between Salesforce's backend Apex logic and the Lightning Aura frontend, rather than containing business logic itself.
