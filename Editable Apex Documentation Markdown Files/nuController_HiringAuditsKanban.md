### Description
This class is designed to interact with Hiring Audits records in Salesforce, providing a mechanism to retrieve a list of hiring audits based on the account ID input. It is structured to be used within the Salesforce Lightning Experience as it contains AuraEnabled annotations, making its methods accessible via the Lightning Component framework.

### Methods

- **getHiringAudits(String accountId)**
   
   ```java
   @AuraEnabled
   public static List<nuHiringAudits> getHiringAudits(String accountId)
   ```

   This method retrieves a list of hiring audits related to either a specific company or agency identified by `accountId`. It constructs a custom list from queried `Hiring_Audit__c` records, encapsulating them within `nuHiringAudits` custom class instances for simpler consumption in the frontend.

### Properties
This documentation doesn't directly describe properties within the `nuController_HiringAuditsKanban` class but references custom objects and fields accessed within its sole method, including:

- `Hiring_Audit__c` (Custom Object): Contains fields such as `Id`, `Name`, `Job_Order__c`, `Candidate_Name__c`, `Current_Stage__c`, `Status__c`, `Agency_Name__c`, `Agency__c`, `Specialty__c`, and `Work_Location__c` used for audit reporting.

### Use Case
A typical use case for this class would involve a scenario where a Salesforce Lightning component needs to display hiring audit information related to either a company or an agency. On loading the component, a call would be made to `getHiringAudits` to fetch relevant audit data based on the ID of the company or agency currently being viewed.

### Important Notes
1. **AuraEnabled Annotation**: This makes the `getHiringAudits` method accessible from Lightning components, but also dictates that calls to this method must handle client-side exceptions, as Aura handled exceptions are returned to the client.
   
2. **Exception Handling**: The method uses a try-catch block to handle and throw a user-friendly error message in case of exceptions. This is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience, ensuring that internal errors do not propagate unhandled to the user interface.

3. **Performance Considerations**: The SOQL query within `getHiringAudits` uses an OR condition across multiple relations. When working with large datasets, consider optimizing the query to ensure performance, potentially using custom indexes or revisiting the logic for data retrieval.
   
4. **Data Security**: The `with sharing` keyword ensures that data access is governed by the organization's sharing rules and permissions, making this class compliant with Salesforce's security model.
