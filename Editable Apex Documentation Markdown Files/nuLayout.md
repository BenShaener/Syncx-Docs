### Description
This class is designed to support the dynamic layout of records and sections within Salesforce Lightning Experience. It facilitates the custom arrangement of fields and quick actions associated with a specific Salesforce object record. This class does not enforce sharing rules, making it suitable for scenarios where the same data visibility is required regardless of the user's permissions.

### Methods
This class does not contain any explicit methods. However, it is equipped with `@AuraEnabled` annotations on its properties, making them accessible for Lightning components in the Salesforce Lightning Experience and Salesforce mobile app.

### Properties
- **recordName**: A `String` representing the name of the Salesforce record.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public String recordName;
  ```
  
- **sobjectType**: A `String` that stores the API name of the Salesforce object (SObject) type.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public String sobjectType;
  ```
  
- **sobjectLabel**: A `String` containing the label of the Salesforce object.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public String sobjectLabel;
  ```
  
- **fieldsBySection**: A `Map<String, List<String>>` where each key represents a section name and its value is a list of field API names to be displayed in that section.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public Map<String, List<String>> fieldsBySection = new Map<String, List<String>>();
  ```
  
- **quickActions**: A `List<String>` containing the API names of the quick actions to be displayed.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public List<String> quickActions = new List<String>();
  ```

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful when building custom UI components that require dynamic rendering of Salesforce object fields and actions based on specific configurations. It can be used in scenarios where a tailored user experience is necessary, beyond what is available through the standard layout configurations in Salesforce.

### Important Notes
- The class is declared as `public without sharing`, indicating that it does not enforce the sharing rules of the current user. Therefore, it should be used with caution, especially in scenarios where data security and visibility are concerns.
  
- Since the properties are annotated with `@AuraEnabled`, they are accessible from Lightning components. This facilitates easy integration with the Salesforce Lightning Experience for rendering dynamic layouts.

- This class structure alone does not perform any operations on Salesforce data. It acts as a data holder and must be utilized in conjunction with Apex methods that populate its properties with appropriate values based on the business logic.
