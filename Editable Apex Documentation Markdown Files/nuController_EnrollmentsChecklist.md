### Description
This class provides functionality related to the enrollment process for placements within a Salesforce org. It supports operations to fetch placements that are actively in the enrollment process and to count the number of enrollments in process for a given contact. It is designed to work with Salesforce Lightning components, utilizing the `@AuraEnabled` annotation to expose its methods to the Salesforce Lightning Experience.

### Methods

1. **getPlacementsInEnrollmentProcess(Id contactId)**
   - **Description**: Retrieves a list of `nuPlacement` records that are in the process of enrollment. It filters placements based on the criteria that the placement has both a client and an employee associated, a non-zero enrollments count, and an enrollment percent complete not equal to 100%.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `contactId` (Id): The Salesforce ID of the Contact record.
   - **Returns**: `List<nuPlacement>`: A list of `nuPlacement` objects meeting the specified criteria.
   - **Use Case**: This method is suitable for fetching all placements for a given contact that are currently in the enrollment process but not yet fully completed.

2. **countEnrollmentsInProcess(Id contactId)**
   - **Description**: Counts the number of enrollments in the process for a specified contact. It looks for `nuPlacement__c` records where the contact is set either as a client or employee and where there is at least one enrollment.
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `contactId` (Id): The Salesforce ID of the Contact record.
   - **Returns**: `nuServiceResult`: An object containing the count of enrollments in process or an error message if the operation fails.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for getting a simple count of how many enrollments are in process for a given contact, which could support dashboards or reporting within the UI.

### Properties

This class does not explicitly define properties; its functionality is encapsulated within its static methods.

### Use Case
A common use case for this class would be in a Salesforce Lightning component that displays information about a contact's engagement with the system, specifically around their involvement in enrollment processes. It could be used in dashboards or informational widgets within the Salesforce UI to provide real-time updates to users about the status of enrollments.

### Important Notes
- Both methods are marked with `@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)`, indicating they are intended to be used with Salesforce's Lightning Data Service which can cache their results for improved performance in the UI.
- Error handling within these methods ensures that exceptions are caught and managed appropriately. However, when integrating these methods into a user interface, additional error handling and user feedback mechanisms should be considered.
- For `getPlacementsInEnrollmentProcess`, there's an attempt to throw a more user-friendly error (`AuraHandledException`) if no matching placements are found, enhancing the user experience by providing clearer, action-oriented error messages.
- The use of custom objects and fields (e.g., `nuPlacement__c`, `Client__c`, `Employee__c`) implies that this code is tailored to a specific Salesforce org's schema. Adjustments may be necessary to align with the schema of another org.
