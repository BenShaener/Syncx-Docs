### Description

This class is designed for managing timesheet entries within a Salesforce environment. It is aimed at tracking an employee's daily work hours, including regular hours, sick hours, PTO, and holiday hours. It also provides functionalities to manage timesheet slots for detailed time entries.

### Methods

There are no explicitly defined methods in this class. However, it utilizes the `@AuraEnabled` annotation to expose its properties for Lightning components, making them accessible for client-side controllers.

### Properties

- `entryId` (String): The unique identifier for the timesheet entry.
- `placementId` (String): Identifier for the placement this entry is associated with.
- `timesheetId` (String): The identifying code of the timesheet this entry is part of.
- `employeeId` (String): The ID of the employee this entry belongs to.
- `entryName` (String): The name associated with the timesheet entry.
- `entryDay` (String): The specific day (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) this entry covers.
- `entryDate` (String): The date of the entry.
- `totalHours` (Decimal): The total hours logged in the entry.
- `totalWorkedHours` (Decimal): The hours worked excluding PTO, sick, and holiday hours.
- `totalPTOHours` (Decimal): Hours allocated to paid time off.
- `totalSickHours` (Decimal): Hours allocated to sick leave.
- `totalHolidayHours` (Decimal): Hours allocated to holidays.
- `allowSlotAdd` (Boolean): Flag to allow or disallow adding new time slots.
- `readonly` (Boolean): Flag to mark the entry as read-only.
- `timeSlots` (List<nuTimesheetSlot>): A list of time slots associated with the timesheet entry.

### Use Case

Primarily, this class can be used in a Salesforce application focused on human resources or project management where employee time tracking is required. Through a UI, users can input their daily hours across various categories (e.g., sick leave, PTO), with the system keeping an aggregate total. This detailed tracking helps in payroll processing, project costing, and resource management. The `allowSlotAdd` and `readonly` properties enable a flexible interface for both the input and review processes.

### Important Notes

1. **Security**: The class is defined as `public without sharing`, meaning it doesn't enforce the sharing rules of the running user. It's important to consider this when dealing with sensitive employee data to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
   
2. **@AuraEnabled**: This annotation makes the properties accessible from Lightning Aura Components, facilitating the integration of this Apex class with Salesforce's Lightning Experience. It's crucial for developers working on the client-side UI to be aware of the structure and data types of these properties for effective binding and manipulation.

3. **Data Types**: When integrating with front-end components, especially when dealing with dates (`entryDate`), careful conversion and formatting might be required to ensure consistency across different locales and time zones.
