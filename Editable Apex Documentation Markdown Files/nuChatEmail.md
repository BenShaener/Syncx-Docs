### Description

This Apex class defines functionality related to sending customized email alerts based on chat messages linked to different Salesforce object records. It evaluates chat messages to determine the appropriate recipient and constructs a personalized email message that includes details such as the chat content, related record information, and work location, aiming to facilitate communication between community users, Salesforce users, and account managers.

### Methods

- `sendEmail(List<Chat_Message__c> chatMessages)`: This is an @invocableMethod, designed to be triggered from Salesforce automation tools (e.g., Flow). It processes a list of `Chat_Message__c` objects, retrieves related data, and determines the email recipient based on the profile of the message creator. After determining the recipient and constructing the email content, it calls `sendEmailLogic` to send the email.

- `sendEmailLogic(String recipient, Chat_Message__c chatMessage, Chat__c chatRecord, String urlI, String emailBody)`: A private helper method that actually sends the email. It uses the Salesforce `Messaging.SingleEmailMessage` class to construct and send the email based on inputs from `sendEmail` method.

### Properties

No public properties are exposed in this class.

### Use Case

This class is particularly useful for Salesforce implementations that have a heavy reliance on communication through chat messages and require an automated way to notify users (community or otherwise) about new or updated chats related to specific records. Usage scenarios include:

- Notifying account managers when community users initiate or reply to a chat.
- Alerting users to new chat messages that relate to particular Salesforce records, enhancing collaboration and response time.
- Facilitating communication flow within Salesforce for users who may not regularly check the platform for chat updates.

### Important Notes

- The usage of `[SELECT ... FROM ...]` SOQL queries inside loops is generally discouraged due to governor limits but is not an issue here since the `sendEmail` method handles a single record at a time. Still, it's important to be mindful of SOQL limits in Salesforce.
- The method assumes that there is always at least one message in the `chatMessages` list and will throw an error if it's empty. Ensure that the method is called with a non-empty list.
- The decision logic for determining the email recipient is based on the `Profile.Name` of the user who created the chat message, distinguishing between 'Community' and other users. This logic may need adjustments depending on the specific Salesforce setup and profile naming conventions.
- The email sending functionality in `sendEmailLogic` is commented out. Before using this class in a live environment, ensure that the lines related to the `Messaging.sendEmail` call are uncommented and properly tested.
- Dynamic URL construction for email bodies relies on specific object and field names, which should be adjusted according to the Salesforce environment where this class will be deployed.
