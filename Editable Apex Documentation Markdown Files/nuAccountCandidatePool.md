### Description
This class is designed to represent a pool of account candidates with specific attributes that can be utilized within Salesforce Lightning components. It is intended for use in scenarios where account candidate information, such as their name, unique identifier, and specialty, needs to be exposed to the Salesforce Lightning Experience UI.

### Methods
This class does not explicitly define any methods; however, it leverages the `@AuraEnabled` annotation to make its properties accessible from Lightning components.

### Properties
- **name**: A `string` property accessible from Lightning components, representing the name of the account candidate.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string name {get; set;}
  ```
- **Ids**: A `string` property accessible from Lightning components, representing the unique identifier(s) of the account candidate.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string Ids {get; set;}
  ```
- **specialty**: A `string` property accessible from Lightning components, representing the specialty of the account candidate.
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public string specialty {get; set;}
  ```

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful in the context of a Salesforce Lightning application where there is a need to display or manage account candidate data dynamically. For example, it can be used in a component that lists account candidates along with their specialties, allowing users to quickly view and select candidates for further actions based on their specialties.

### Important Notes
- The use of the `@AuraEnabled` annotation indicates that this class is intended to work closely with Salesforce Lightning Components. This property exposure is necessary for components to read and write data back to the controller.
- Since this class does not include explicit methods beyond property getters and setters, its primary function is to serve as a data model within the Salesforce Lightning Framework.
- The `Ids` property is named in a potentially misleading way, as it suggests multiple IDs might be contained within a single string, which could complicate parsing or usage. Care should be taken when implementing components that interact with this property to ensure correct handling of the ID(s).
