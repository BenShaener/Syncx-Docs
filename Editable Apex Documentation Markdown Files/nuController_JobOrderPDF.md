### Description
This Apex class provides functionality to manage and generate a PDF document for a Job Order record in Salesforce. It primarily focuses on retrieving job order details, associated rates, and generating a PDF document with these details, which is then attached to the job order record.

### Methods

- **nuController_JobOrderPDF(ApexPages.StandardController sdc)**: A constructor that does not perform any specific operation.

- **nuController_JobOrderPDF()**: A default constructor that initializes class properties by querying data related to a job order record, including its details and related rate records from the database.

- **generateJobOrderPDF(String jobOrderId, String recordType)**: This static method is annotated with `@AuraEnabled` making it accessible for Lightning components. It generates a PDF document for the specified Job Order, deletes any existing PDFs to avoid duplicates, and attaches the new PDF to the Job Order record. Additionally, it returns information about the generated PDF through an instance of `nuServiceResult`.

- **FieldData**: An inner class to define the structure of field data with properties `Label` and `Value`, along with a parameterized constructor.

### Properties

- **recordId**: The ID of the Job Order record.
- **recordType**: The type of the record (used for differentiation in context).
- **data**: General purpose String data placeholder.
- **fieldsData**: A list of `FieldData` objects to store label and value data for dynamic handling.
- **job**: Stores fetched `Job_Order__c` record details.
- **fieldsBySection**: A list to dynamically manage data by sections, its initialization and usage is not specified within the provided code.
- **ratesList**: A list of `Rate__c` records associated with the Job Order.

### Use Case
This class can be utilized in scenarios where there's a need to generate and manage PDF documents for Job Orders in Salesforce. It finds application within Lightning components or Visualforce pages where administrators or users need to generate a PDF outline of a job order's details including rates for presentations or records. This could be particularly useful for sales or recruitment teams in staffing agencies.

### Important Notes
- The class is defined as `public without sharing`, which means it does not enforce the sharing rules of the running user. Be cautious about using it in scenarios requiring strict data security.
- The `generateJobOrderPDF` method assumes the presence of a Visualforce page named `nuJobOrderPDF` to generate the PDF content. Ensure this page is correctly set up and tested.
- The class performs deletions and DML operations within its methods. Ensure to handle potential exceptions and maintain bulkification where used in larger contexts to avoid hitting governor limits.
- The usage of `fieldsBySection` is not demonstrated in the provided code. If you intend to use this property, further implementation details will be needed.
