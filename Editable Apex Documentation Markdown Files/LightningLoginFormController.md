### Description
This controller is designed specifically for handling user authentication in Salesforce Lightning components. It provides a set of methods to perform login operations, check for authentication configuration settings like username/password authentication, self-registration availability, retrieve URLs for self-registration and forgot password, and set an experience Id for the site.

### Methods
- **login(String username, String password, String startUrl)**: Authenticates a user with the provided credentials and redirects to a specified URL upon successful login.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static String login(String username, String password, String startUrl)
  ```

- **getIsUsernamePasswordEnabled()**: Checks if the username and password-based authentication is enabled or not.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static Boolean getIsUsernamePasswordEnabled()
  ```

- **getIsSelfRegistrationEnabled()**: Determines if the self-registration feature is enabled.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static Boolean getIsSelfRegistrationEnabled()
  ```

- **getSelfRegistrationUrl()**: Retrieves the URL for the self-registration page, if self-registration is enabled.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static String getSelfRegistrationUrl()
  ```

- **getForgotPasswordUrl()**: Retrieves the URL for the forgot password page.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  public static String getForgotPasswordUrl()
  ```

- **setExperienceId(String expId)**: Sets the Experience Id for the site, affecting the site's appearance and functionality based on the configured Experience Cloud site template.
  
  ```java
  @AuraEnabled
  global static String setExperienceId(String expId)
  ```

### Properties
There are no explicit properties exposed by the controller other than the methods designed for AuraEnabled access.

### Use Case
The controller is ideal for Salesforce Lightning applications that require user authentication functionality. It can be used to create custom login forms, enable users to self-register, retrieve the URL for users who have forgotten their password, and set an Experience Id for customizing the site's appearance.

### Important Notes
- All the `@AuraEnabled` methods are static, making them directly accessible from Lightning components without instantiating the controller.
- The `login` method uses `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions, which allows for error messages to be returned directly to the Lightning component for user-friendly error handling.
- Authentication settings like username/password and self-registration availability are fetched using the `getAuthConfig` method, which is marked with `@TestVisible` for easier access in test classes.
- The `setExperienceId` method is global, allowing it to be called not only from within Salesforce but also from external sources if necessary. However, it's essential to consider the security implications when exposing methods globally.
