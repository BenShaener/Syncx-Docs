### Description
This Apex class provides functionality to retrieve information related to `NuPlacement__c` records based on a given Contact ID. It primarily aims to find NuPlacement records that are associated with the contact's related accounts and match specific criteria based on the contact's specialties and provider types.

### Methods

#### `getPlacementsByContactId(List<Id> contactId)`
- **Description**: Retrieves a nested list of `NuPlacement__c` record IDs based on the provided Contact ID. It performs a series of queries to gather related Account IDs, associated provider types, and specialties from the Contact record. Then, it queries for `NuPlacement__c` records that are associated with these accounts and match the specified provider types and specialties.
- **Parameters**: `List<Id> contactId` - A list containing a single Contact ID for which related NuPlacement records need to be retrieved.
- **Returns**: `List<List<Id>>` - A nested list containing the IDs of matching `NuPlacement__c` records.
- **Example**:
  ```java
  List<Id> contactIds = new List<Id>{'003XXXXXXXYYYYZZZ'};
  List<List<Id>> placements = nuCancellationQueries.getPlacementsByContactId(contactIds);
  ```

### Properties
No explicit properties are defined within this class outside of the local variables inside the method.

### Use Case
This class is particularly useful in scenarios where an application or a Salesforce process needs to programmatically identify `NuPlacement__c` records that are relevant to a specific contact. For instance, a process that triggers follow-ups or updates based on the contact's associated placements.

### Important Notes
- The method expects a list as an input for the `contactId` parameter but utilizes only the first element of this list. If the list contains more than one ID, those after the first will be ignored.
- The queries do not handle the scenario where the Contact record might not exist or the provided ID is invalid. Implementing error handling around these cases would be advisable.
- The method combines parent and child account relationships for a comprehensive search but does not consider duplicate account entries, which could potentially lead to redundant data processing.
