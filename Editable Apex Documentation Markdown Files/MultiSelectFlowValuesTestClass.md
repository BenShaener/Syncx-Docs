### Description
This class is designed for testing the functionality of multi-select values in flows within Salesforce. It primarily focuses on verifying if the `MultiselectFlowvalues.CheckValues` method works as expected by passing a list of strings as parameters.

### Methods
- **MultiSelectFlowValuesTest()**: This is a static method annotated with `@isTest`, indicating it's a test method. The method initializes a list of strings, adds multiple values to this list, and then calls the `MultiselectFlowvalues.CheckValues` method with this list as its argument. It does not return any value.

### Properties
This test class does not explicitly define properties; its sole purpose is to contain test methods that operate on locally scoped variables within those methods.

### Use Case
The typical use case for this class is during the unit testing phase of Salesforce development. When developers need to ensure that the `MultiselectFlowvalues.CheckValues` method can correctly handle an input list of strings, this class provides a straightforward way to verify that functionality. It simulates a scenario where multiple values selected in a Salesforce flow need to be checked or validated through the `CheckValues` method.

### Important Notes
- This class must be run as part of your Salesforce org's test execution phase, typically during deployment or as part of continuous integration testing processes.
- It uses hard-coded values for testing, which means if the `CheckValues` method’s logic is significantly dependent on dynamic or org-specific data, additional test methods or more sophisticated testing strategies might be required.
- Being annotated with `@isTest`, this class does not count against your org’s Apex code limits.
- The success of the test method `MultiSelectFlowValuesTest` is contingent upon the correct implementation of the `MultiselectFlowvalues.CheckValues` method. If modifications to the logic of `CheckValues` are made, it may necessitate updates to this test class to ensure continued relevance and accuracy in testing.
