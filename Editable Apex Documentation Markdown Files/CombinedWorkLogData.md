### Description
The `CombinedWorkLogData` class is designed to interact with timesheet and invoice objects in a Salesforce environment. It includes methods to fetch timesheet data related to specific object IDs or work locations, retrieve all invoices, save a PDF of timesheets based on their IDs, send attachments, and retrieve the domain name of the system. There is also a method included for incrementing an integer that seems to serve no business purpose and appears to be for demonstration or testing.

### Methods
1. `fetchTimeSheetData(Id objId, String objectType)`: Fetches timesheet records related to a given object ID. If the object type is an Account, it directly uses the provided object ID; otherwise, it finds the associated Account ID based on the provided object ID.

2. `fetchInvoices()`: Retrieves all invoice records available.

3. `fetchTimeSheetDataByWorkLocation(Id workLocationId)`: Fetches timesheet records related to a specific work location ID.

4. `savePdf(String timeSheetIds)`: Generates and returns a PDF blob of timesheets given their IDs.

5. `sendAttachment(String timeSheetIds)`: Sends an attachment of timesheets given their IDs.

6. `getmydomain()`: Retrieves the domain name of the current Salesforce org.

7. `justIncrement()`: Increments an integer multiple times, serving no apparent practical purpose.

### Properties
No public properties are explicitly defined apart from the methods marked with `@AuraEnabled`, making them accessible from Lightning components.

### Use Case
This class can be utilized in a Lightning Component or Aura Application that requires interaction with timesheet and invoice data. For instance, displaying lists of timesheets and invoices, generating and downloading timesheet PDFs, and sending timesheet attachments via email. It can also be called to obtain the Salesforce org's domain name, useful for dynamically generating URLs within applications.

### Important Notes
- The `fetchTimeSheetData` and `fetchTimeSheetDataByWorkLocation` methods include commented-out conditions in their queries, suggesting there might be requirements to filter out certain statuses which are not currently in effect.
  
- The `savePdf` and `sendAttachment` methods depend on a separate class (`GenerateTimeSheet_LGT_CLS`) for their functionality, indicating a dependency that must be maintained.

- The `justIncrement` method seems to serve as an example or test and does not contribute to the main functionalities of the class.

- Exception handling is implemented in the methods retrieving invoices and timesheets by work location, indicating an awareness of the need to manage potential runtime errors gracefully.

- Security is partially managed by utilizing parameterized SOQL queries to defend against SOQL injection attacks, an important consideration when dynamically including ID values in queries.
