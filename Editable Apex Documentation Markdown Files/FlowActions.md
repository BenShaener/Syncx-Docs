### Description

This Apex class contains methods designed to automate the creation of Compliance Credential and Enrollment records associated with Placement records in Salesforce. It supports generating these records based on the compliance requirements and enrollment requirements configured in the system, linking them to specific candidate documents while considering their specialty, company affiliation, and any expiration constraints.

### Methods

- `createCompCreds(List<Id> placementsIds)`: This method is exposed as an invocable method allowing it to be called from Salesforce Flows or Process Builder. It takes a list of Placement record IDs as input and generates Compliance Credential records based on predefined compliance requirements associated with the Placement's company and specialty. The method also triggers the creation of Enrollment records by calling the private `createEnrollments` method.

  ```java
  public static List<Compliance_Credential__c> createCompCreds(List<Id> placementsIds)
  ```

- `createEnrollments(Id placementsIds)`: A private method that generates Enrollment records for a given Placement ID, using the candidate, company, and specialty to find matching active Enrollment Documents and creating new Enrollment records based on the relevant Enrollment Requirements.

  ```java
  private static List<Enrollment__c> createEnrollments(Id placementsIds)
  ```

### Properties

- This class does not specifically define properties outside of its methods but operates on custom Salesforce objects such as `Compliance_Credential__c`, `Credential__c`, `nuPlacement__c`, `Compliance_Requirement__c`, `Enrollment__c`, and `Enrollment_Document__c` to manage compliance and enrollment data.

### Use Case

A common use case for this class is in a Salesforce implementation where there is a need to automate the compliance and enrollment process for candidates placed in different positions. By leveraging this class, the process can be initiated directly from a Salesforce Flow or Process Builder, reducing manual input and ensuring that compliance and enrollment records are created based on up-to-date requirements and linked to the correct candidate documents.

### Important Notes

- The `createCompCreds` method assumes the existence of specific relationship fields and custom objects. Proper setup of these objects and relationships in Salesforce is a prerequisite for the successful functioning of this class.
- The methods focus on processing one Placement record at a time. Although the input parameter is a List, only the first element is used. If there's a need to process multiple Placements, additional logic or batch processing implementation may be required.
- The class is defined as `without sharing`, meaning it does not enforce record-level access checks. This design should be carefully considered in the context of Salesforce's sharing model to ensure compliance with data security requirements.
- Both methods perform DML operations (`insert`) directly. Therefore, handling of bulk operations or potential exceptions should be considered to ensure robustness and scalability of this functionality within larger data volumes or batch processes.
