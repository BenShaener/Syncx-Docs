### Description

The `NuRatesTable` component extends the Salesforce `LightningDatatable` component to add custom functionality specifically for managing picklist columns. This component allows users to use a custom data type `picklistColumn` for displaying and editing picklist values within a table cell. The implementation includes separate templates for display (`pickliststatic.html`) and edit modes (`picklistColumn.html`), along with the capability to customize the picklist behavior and appearance through a set of defined attributes.

### Methods

This component inherits all methods from the `LightningDatatable` component but does not define any additional methods of its own.

### Properties

The `NuRatesTable` component introduces a custom data type `picklistColumn` with several properties defined under `typeAttributes`. These properties include:

- `label`: The label of the picklist field.
- `placeholder`: A placeholder text that appears when the picklist field is empty.
- `options`: A list of options for the picklist.
- `value`: The currently selected value of the picklist.
- `context`: Any additional context needed for the picklist field.
- `variant`: The visual variant of the picklist field.
- `name`: The unique name of the picklist field.

### Use Case

The custom `NuRatesTable` component is particularly useful in scenarios where a Salesforce Lightning datatable needs to include one or more columns that allow users to select from predefined options (picklists). For instance, an application managing financial rates might use this component to allow users to specify rate types (e.g., Fixed, Variable) directly within a table row.

### Important Notes

1. **Templates**: The custom component requires two separate HTML templates â€“ one for the static display mode (`pickliststatic.html`) and another for the edit mode (`picklistColumn.html`). These templates need to be properly defined and stored in the same directory as the JavaScript class.

2. **Inheritance**: Since `NuRatesTable` extends `LightningDatatable`, it inherits all of its properties, methods, and behaviors. This means that apart from the custom functionality introduced, all standard datatable functionalities are available.

3. **Custom Types**: The usage of `static customTypes` defines a way to extend the datatable with custom data types. This is a powerful feature that allows developers to introduce complex field types beyond the standard ones (e.g., text, number, date) provided by Lightning Web Components (LWC).

4. **`typeAttributes`**: These attributes provide a flexible way to pass configurations and controls to the custom picklist column, enabling a wide range of use cases and custom behaviors.

Example usage within a Lightning Web Component could involve defining a datatable in the component's HTML template and specifying columns in the JavaScript class that utilize this custom `picklistColumn` type, setting up the necessary options, and handling value changes as desired by the application logic.
