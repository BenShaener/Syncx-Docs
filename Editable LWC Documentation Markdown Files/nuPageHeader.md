### Description

The Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuPageHeader` is designed to serve as a custom page header within Salesforce Lightning Experience. This component integrates with Salesforce's design system (SLDS) to display breadcrumb navigation and a page title. It also embodies navigation functionality, allowing users to return to the homepage with a click.

### Methods

- **navigateToHomePage**:
  
  This method enables the component to navigate back to the Salesforce homepage when invoked. The navigation is achieved by using the `NavigationMixin.Navigate` method provided by the `lightning/navigation` module. 

  ```javascript
  navigateToHomePage() {
      this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
          type: 'standard__namedPage',
          attributes: {
              pageName: 'home'
          },
      });
  }
  ```
  The `navigateToHomePage` function is tied to the `Home` breadcrumb link within the component's template, and it's triggered via an `onclick` event.

### Properties

- **@api heading**:
  
  This public property (`@api`) allows the parent component to pass a string value that serves as the heading or title of the webpage. This title is displayed in a `<h1>` tag with appropriate styling as per Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS).
  
  The usage in the template is demonstrated as follows:

  ```html
  <h1 class="slds-text-heading--medium slds-truncate" title="Available Orders">{heading}</h1>
  ```

### Use Case

The `NuPageHeader` component can be employed across various custom pages within a Salesforce Lightning application to provide a consistent user experience. It's particularly useful in scenarios where navigation to the home page and displaying page titles are requisite elements of the user interface.

For instance, it could be used on a custom orders page, where the header displays "Available Orders" and offers a breadcrumb navigation back to the home page for easy user orientation and navigation.

### Important Notes

- The component uses the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling, ensuring that it adheres to the visual language of the Lightning Experience.
- Navigation functionality is leveraged through the `NavigationMixin` from `lightning/navigation`, which is a Salesforce standard for enabling navigation in Lightning Web Components.
- The breadcrumb navigation is designed to be accessible, with an assistive text "You are here:" that's aimed at screen readers, improving the component's usability for users with disabilities.
- The commented-out `<p>` tag within the template suggests a provision for displaying additional information (like record counts) which can be uncommented and utilized if needed.
- Remember to replace `javascript:void(0)` in the anchor tag's `href` attribute with a more appropriate, navigational link if extending the breadcrumb functionality.
