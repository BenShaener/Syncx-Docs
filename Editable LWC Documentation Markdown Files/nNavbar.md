### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NNavbar` is designed to dynamically display a navigation bar tailored for different portal types, such as Agency, Candidate, or Company (Client). It showcases various navigational links with submenu capabilities and adapts its layout responsively across devices. The component's behavior is controlled by JavaScript and its appearance is defined in CSS, both highly reliant on the component's state and properties fetched from the Salesforce database, including customization like dynamic styling and logos.

### Methods

- **navigateToHome**: Navigates the user to the home page when invoked.

```javascript
navigateToHome() {
    this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
        type: 'standard__namedPage',
        attributes: {
            name: 'Home'
        },
    });
}
```

- **navigateToPage**: Navigates to a specific page based on the data attribute 'data-navinfo' of the clicked element.

```javascript
navigateToPage(e) {
    // Implementation; uses `this.navigationInformation` map and `this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]`
}
```

- **handleMobileNav**: Toggles the visibility of the mobile navigation view.

```javascript
handleMobileNav() {
    this.appClicked = !this.appClicked;
}
```

### Properties

- **isAgency, isCandidate, isClient**: Computed properties determining the type of portal user.

```javascript
get isAgency() {
    return (this.portalType && this.portalType === 'Agency');
}
```

- **linkContainerClass, closeClass**: Computed properties generating CSS class names based on the state of navigation.

```javascript
get linkContainerClass() {
    if(this.appClicked) return 'link-container mobile-view';
    else return 'link-container';
}
```

- **portal, testContactId**: Public properties (`@api`) that can be set externally, influencing the component's behavior like the type of user or data to be tested.

### Use Case

In a Salesforce Community Portal, `NNavbar` could be used to provide a consistent navigation experience across different portal types (Agency, Candidate, Company). It adapts the available navigation links and the appearance based on the user's role and other settings (like branding options specified in Salesforce records). For instance, an Agency user would see links to manage Candidates and Job Orders, whereas a Candidate user would have options related to Time Management and their Schedule.

### Important Notes

- **Dynamic Styling and Branding**: The component supports dynamic theming based on the user's associated account settings (e.g., Primary Color, Logo URL), making it adaptable to various corporate identities.
- **Responsiveness**: It features responsive design through CSS media queries, changing the layout for mobile devices to offer a hamburger menu for compact navigation.
- **Navigation**: Uses Salesforce's `NavigationMixin` for navigating between different pages or views within the Salesforce platform, using a predefined map (`navigationInformation`) that pairs actions to specific page attributes.
- **Lightning Web Component (LWC) Lifecycle**: While there's a placeholder for the `connectedCallback` lifecycle hook with commented-out code, it hints at potential uses like fetch operations upon component initialization to retrieve user or account-specific data.
- **Commented Code**: The component contains commented-out sections that might serve as placeholders for future features (like notifications). It's important to review and clean these if they remain unused to maintain code clarity.
