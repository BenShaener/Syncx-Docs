### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to provide a modal popup that facilitates the cancellation of a hiring audit. When users invoke this action, they are presented with a form within a modal that captures the reason for the cancellation. It utilizes Salesforce's `lightning-record-edit-form` to interact with the Hiring Audit object's records directly. This form is initially populated with some default values but allows the user to input a cancellation reason. The component also updates related records upon successful form submission.

### Methods

1. **handleResult:** A wired method to fetch data for the initial state of the component based on the provided `placementId`. It sets the `hiringAuditId` for further operations.

2. **doSubmit:** Invoked when the user clicks the submit button. It submits the form and shows a spinner if the cancellation reason is provided.

3. **successHandler:** Handles the successful submission of the form. It updates the related placement record to mark it as 'Cancelled' and then dispatches a `finishquickaction` event to close the modal.

4. **errorHandler:** Logs errors to the console if the form submission fails.

5. **closeQuickAction:** Hides the spinner and dispatches the `finishquickaction` event to close the modal. Triggered when the cancel button is clicked.

### Properties

- **hiringAuditId**: stores the Id of the Hiring Audit record. It's marked with `@api`, making it publicly accessible to the parent component.
- **placementId**: stores the Id of the Placement record. This is also exposed to the parent component via `@api`.
- **hiringAuditObject, statusField, stageField, reasonField**: represent schema details of the Hiring Audit object and its fields.
- **showSpinner**: controls the visibility of a spinner during async operations.
- **statusValue, stageValue, reason**: default values and user-entered reason for the cancellation form.

### Use Case

This component is ideal for situations where a user needs to cancel a hiring audit, requiring a reason for such action. The component is meant to be used as a Quick Action, integrated into record pages where it can be invoked to easily cancel hiring audits and automatically update related records with minimal user input.

### Important Notes

1. **Schema Dependency**: This component depends on specific schema elements (`Hiring_Audit__c` and its fields) being present in the Salesforce org. Ensure these schema elements exist and are accessible to the component.

2. **Security**: Ensure that users who have access to invoke this action have the necessary permissions to read from and write to the related records.

3. **Lightning Data Service**: Leveraging `lightning/uiRecordApi` for record fetching and updates facilitates ease of development with built-in caching and reduced Apex reliance. However, ensure that the orgâ€™s data limits are considered when scaling usage.

4. **Event Handling**: The component dispatches a `finishquickaction` event upon successful updation or cancellation. The parent component or application needs to handle this event appropriately to ensure a seamless user experience.

5. **UI**: The component uses SLDS classes for styling to adhere to Salesforce's Lightning Design System standards, ensuring a consistent user interface across the Salesforce platform.
