### Description
This Salesforce Lightning Web Component named `AvailableOrdersList` is designed to display a list of available job orders fetched from an Apex class. It showcases job orders with various details such as Job Order ID, Client, Description, Specialty, Job Order Status, Start Date, and End Date. The component provides functionality for sorting and infinite loading of job order data.

### Methods

- **connectedCallback**: Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initializes component properties and fetches initial data.
- **renderedCallback**: Lifecycle hook that runs after the component has finished the rendering phase. It is used here for loading data into the datatable.
- **doSorting**: Function to handle sorting events emitted by the `lightning-datatable`.
- **sortData**: Helper function used to sort the datatable based on the column selected for sorting.
- **navigateToHomePage**: Utilizes the NavigationMixin to navigate to the home page of the Salesforce org.
- **loadMoreData**: Function triggered to load more job orders when the user scrolls down the data table, implementing infinite loading.

### Properties

- **testAgencyId**: Public property (`@api` decorated) used for testing by allowing the agency ID to be set externally.
- **agencyId**: Stores the ID of the agency fetched based on the contact related to the current user.
- **contactId**: Stores the ID of the contact fetched based on the current user.
- **error**: Stores any error messages encountered during data retrieval.
- **columns**: Holds the column definitions for the `lightning-datatable`.
- **availableJobOrders**: Array that stores the job orders fetched.
- **defaultSortDirection, sortDirection**: Determine the current and default direction of sorting in the datatable.
- **sortedBy**: Specifies the field name that the data is currently sorted by.
- **recordCount**: The number of records currently displayed in the datatable.
- **totalNumberOfRows**: The total number of job order rows available.
- **renderConfig**: Holds rendering configurations for the datatable, particularly related to virtual scrolling.
- **loadMoreStatus**: Text status displayed based on whether more data is loading or all data has been loaded.

### Use Case
This component is useful for applications within a Salesforce Org that need to present a list of available job orders to the user in a tabular format. It supports sorting by columns and infinite scrolling to load more data. It could be particularly useful for staffing agencies or companies looking to manage and display job orders accessed by their staff or users from a Salesforce org.

### Important Notes

- **Dynamic Styling**: This component adapts its styling based on certain criteria such as the `Use_Portal_Theme__c` flag of the related account. If true, it dynamically adjusts border and background color styles based on account properties.
- **Infinite Loading**: Through the `lightning-datatable` attribute `enable-infinite-loading` and the `loadMoreData` JS method, the component supports loading data as the user scrolls.
- **Sortable Columns**: Columns are defined with sortable properties for enhanced user interaction, allowing users to sort the job order list based on column headers.
- **Page Lifecycle Hooks**: Utilizes `connectedCallback` & `renderedCallback` lifecycle hooks for fetching initial data and managing rendering logic.
- **NavigationMixin**: This component uses `NavigationMixin` for navigating to the home page, demonstrating how to embed navigation functionality within a Lightning Web Component.

```javascript
navigateToHomePage() {
    this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
        type: 'standard__namedPage',
        attributes: {
            pageName: 'home'
        },
    });
}
```

Make sure that all Apex methods referenced in the JS controller (`fetchContactId`, `fetchAccountByContactId`, `fetchAvailableOrders`, `fetchAvailableOrderCount`) are properly implemented and accessible by the component.
