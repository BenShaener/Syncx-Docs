### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `CustomLookup` is designed as a custom lookup component, providing a dynamic and reusable search capability. It allows users to search for records by typing in a search key, displaying matching results in a dropdown list, from which users can select. Once a selection is made, the component displays the chosen record in a pill format, with the option to clear the selection. The component is styled using Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes for a consistent look and feel with the Salesforce experience.

### Methods

- **connectedCallback()**: Initializes the component by fetching a default record if `defaultRecordId` is provided.
- **handleKeyChange(event)**: Triggers when the user types in the search input. It performs a debounced search operation and fetches matching records based on the input.
- **toggleResult(event)**: Toggles the visibility of the search results dropdown based on user interaction (e.g., clicking outside the component).
- **handleRemove()**: Clears the currently selected record and resets the component to its initial state, showing the search input.
- **handelSelectedRecord(event)**: Handles the selection of a record from the search results, updating the component to display the selected record as a pill.
- **handelSelectRecordHelper()**: A helper method used to switch the UI view from the search input to the selected record display.
- **lookupUpdatehandler(value)**: Fires a custom event named 'lookupupdate' with the detail of the selected record, allowing parent components to react to the selection.

### Properties

- **@api label**: Public property for setting the label of the lookup field.
- **@api placeholder**: Public property for setting the placeholder text of the search input. Default value is 'search...'.
- **@api iconName**: Public property to specify the icon displayed in the search results and selected record pill. Default is 'standard:account'.
- **@api [location, providerType, specialty, agency]**: Public properties to capture additional filter criteria for the search operation.
- **@api defaultRecordId**: Public property for setting a default record ID to pre-populate the component.
- **@api recordType**: Public property to specify the type of records to search for.
- **@api hideClearButton**: Public property to control the visibility of the clear button.
- **@api selectedId**: Public property to hold the ID of the selected record.

### Use Case

This component is ideal for scenarios where users need to select a specific record from a potentially large set of data, such as choosing a contact, account, or any custom object record. It can be particularly useful in forms where a lookup to related records is required but with a customizable UI and functionality beyond what is provided by the standard Salesforce lookup fields.

### Important Notes

1. **Async Operations**: The component makes asynchronous calls to Apex methods to fetch data. It's crucial to handle these operations properly to ensure the component remains responsive and the UI is updated correctly.
2. **Debouncing**: To optimize performance and reduce the number of server calls, search input handling is debounced. This means the component waits for a fixed amount of time (defined by `DELAY`) after the user stops typing before performing the search operation.
3. **Error Handling**: While this code snippet does not explicitly include error handling logic for apex calls, it is important to implement error handling to provide feedback to the user in the event of an issue.
4. **Custom Events**: The component dispatches a `lookupupdate` custom event when a record is selected, allowing for easy integration and interaction with parent components.

```javascript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('lookupupdate', { 'detail': {selectedRecord: value} }));
```

5. **Security**: Ensure that the Apex methods called by this component enforce proper sharing and security checks to prevent unauthorized data access.
