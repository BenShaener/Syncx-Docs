### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `AgencyScheduler` is designed to manage and display the scheduling of shifts and availability for providers in a calendar format. It includes a range of functionalities such as adding, claiming, releasing, confirming, and canceling shifts, along with specifying the availability of providers. It also includes a variety of filters to narrow down the events shown on the calendar, such as shift type, location, candidate type, and specialty filters. It uses several custom components (`c-nu-page-layout`, `c-nu-calendar`, `c-nu-searchable-multi-picklist`, etc.) for layout and functionality purposes.

### Methods

1. **connectedCallback**: Used to fetch initial data sets when the component is inserted into the DOM. It makes Apex calls to retrieve contact information, account by contact ID, placements by agency ID, and sets initial data and styles based on fetched data.

2. **renderedCallback**: Called after every render of the component. This is used to ensure that the client's CSS is loaded only once.

3. **handleSaveChangesClick**: Manages the saving of changes made to the shifts in the calendar. This includes actions like adding shifts, removing shifts, confirming shifts, claiming shifts, releasing claims, and canceling shifts.

4. **handleDiscardChangesClick**: Discards all the unsaved changes made to shifts, resetting any claims, adds, confirms, etc., and clears the filters.

5. **handleCalendarSelectedEventsUpdated**: Reacts to calendar events selection changes to manage state across the multiple calendar instances.

6. **processPlacementResults**: Processes placements data to extract and set information for shift options, provider options, and account locations.

7. **handleActionClick**: Determines actions based on selected options in the action panel and opens the respective modals for adding availability, confirming shifts, etc.

### Use Case

It can be used to display scheduled shifts on a calendar, filter shifts based on various criteria, and perform actions such as adding, claiming, releasing, confirming, and canceling shifts.

### Important Notes

- This component relies on several custom components and Apex methods for its functionality, so ensure those dependencies are properly set up in the Salesforce org.
- The component uses Lightning Data Service (LDS) and Apex to fetch data, emphasizing the need for correct Apex class permissions for the target users.
- Ensure that the CSS file defined in CLIENT_CSS is available in your Salesforce org and has the expected styles defined for the intended visual appearance.
- The component uses `localStorage` for storing some temporary state data; be mindful of the browser's restrictions and security considerations around its use.
- The component demonstrates a sophisticated use of LWCâ€™s reactivity and event handling to manage complex interactions within the calendar UI, making extensive use of template conditionals and iteration, event dispatching and handling, and dynamic CSS.
