### Description

The `OrderApprovalActionPanel` component provides a user interface for approving or rejecting job orders within the Salesforce Lightning Experience. It leverages the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling, making it visually consistent with the Salesforce environment. It has a combination of buttons, a combobox for selection, and textarea fields to capture user inputs and comments. When certain criteria are met, it allows users to approve or reject job orders, providing an option to input comments for both actions. This component also displays a modal window for rejection comments.

### Methods

1. **approveJobOrderAsync(recordId)**: Asynchronously approves a job order by calling the `approveJobOrder` Apex method. It displays a success or error toast message based on the action's result.

```javascript
async approveJobOrderAsync(recordId) { /* implementation */ }
```

2. **rejectJobOrderAsync(recordId, rejectComment)**: Asynchronously rejects a job order by calling the `rejectJobOrder` Apex method. It too, displays a success or error toast message based on the action's result.

```javascript
async rejectJobOrderAsync(recordId, rejectComment) { /* implementation */ }
```

### Properties

1. **recordId (@api)**: The Salesforce record ID of the job order being processed.

2. **comment (@track)**: The approval comment typed by the user.

3. **rejectComment (@track)**: The rejection comment typed by the user in the modal window.

4. **openModal (@track)**: A boolean flag that controls the visibility of the rejection comment modal window.

5. **canApprove (@track)**: A boolean flag indicating if the user has the permission to approve or reject the job order.

6. **availableTo (@track)**: An array of options for the 'Select Availability' combobox, populated based on Salesforce Picklist values.

7. **selectedOption (@track)**: Stores the currently selected option from the 'Select Availability' combobox. Defaults to "Internal".

### Use Case

This component could be used in a Salesforce Lightning record page specifically designed for job order management. It provides a convenient way for users to approve or reject job orders based on the availability and other criteria direct from within the record's UI.

### Important Notes

- This component relies on custom Apex methods (`canApprove`, `approveJobOrder`, `rejectJobOrder`) and utility methods (like `fireToast`), which need to be defined in your Salesforce Org.
- Proper permissions should be configured to ensure the correct visibility of the component based on the user's role or profile.
- The component uses a combination of Lightning Base Components (`lightning-button`, `lightning-combobox`, `lightning-textarea`, etc.) and SLDS classes for styling and structure, ensuring a cohesive look and feel within the Salesforce environment.
- Error handling is crucial for both Apex calls and UI feedback. Make sure to thoroughly test for edge cases and unexpected behaviors.
