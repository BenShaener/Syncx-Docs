### Description

This documentation covers the Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) `NuTimesheetEntryView`. The component displays a timesheet entry in either a vertical or horizontal layout, depending on the configuration. It includes functionality for adding shift slots to a given entry, conditional rendering based on the component's state, and customization through various properties.

### Methods

#### connectedCallback()

Executed when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initializes component state, specifically determining the `allowSlotAdd` property based on the presence of time slots in the `entry` property.

#### renderedCallback()

Executed after the component is rendered in the DOM. It is used to query child components and perform debugging operations, along with initializing the `accessSlots` property with child component references.

#### handleAddSlotClick()

Handles the click event on the Add Shift button by firing a custom event `addslotclick` with the current entry data.

#### updateAllowAdd(event)

An event handler for internal events that updates the `allowSlotAdd` property based on incoming event details.

### Properties

- `debugVar` (api): Used for debugging purposes.
- `debugTarget` (api): Target component for debugging.
- `mode` (api): Specifies the mode of the component.
- `layout` (api): Determines the layout (`vertical` or `horizontal`) of the component.
- `entry` (api): The timesheet entry data.
- `allowSlotAdd` (api): Controls the visibility of the Add Shift button.
- `showSlotInput` (api): Determines whether the slot input is visible.
- `updatedDate` (api): Date when the entry was last updated.
- `editMode` (api): Flag to toggle edit mode.
- `showShift`, `showUnpaidBreak`, `showNote` (api): Flags to control the visibility of various elements.
- `autoBreakValue` (api): Value for automatically calculated break.
- `shiftOptions`, `otShifts`, `multidayShifts`, `breakShifts`, `hoursOnlyShifts` (api): Arrays representing different configuration options for shifts.
- `unpaidBreakOptions` (api): Options related to unpaid break times.
- `verticalLayout`: Computed property based on `layout`, determines if the layout is vertical.

### Use Case

The `NuTimesheetEntryView` component can be used in a Salesforce application where timesheet management is essential. Users can see an overview of their shifts or specific timesheet entries presented in a chosen layout. The component supports additions of new shift slots, offering flexibility in managing work times, especially for scenarios with complex or varying shift schedules.

### Important Notes

- To use custom CSS and utility functions (`nuUtils`), ensure these are properly imported and available in your Salesforce org.
- The structure of the `entry` property should align with the component's expectations, especially for properties accessed directly within the template.
- Handling of events (`addslotclick` and internal component events) requires proper setup in the parent component to respond to user actions effectively.
- The component dynamically updates based on its properties, making it versatile for different use cases but requiring careful state management.
