## Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuCandidateEnrollmentsChecklist` is designed to manage enrollment processes for assignments. It displays a list of placements in the enrollment process which allows users to select a specific placement and manage its enrollments. Once a placement is selected, the component dynamically displays enrollment stages and related actions for each enrollment. It supports actions such as viewing enrollment details, adding a new enrollment, and modifying existing enrollments. The component makes use of Salesforce's Lightning Data Service (LDS) for CRUD operations and uses custom Apex methods to fetch data.

## Methods

### handleObjInfo
This method is used to fetch picklist values for the `Enrollment__c` object. It dynamically sets the `pickVals` and `statusPickVals` attributes based on the picklist values of 'Current Stage' and 'Status' fields, respectively.

```js
@wire(getPicklistValuesByRecordType,{objectApiName: ENROLLMENT_OBJECT, recordTypeId: '012000000000000AAA'})
```

### handleResult
Used to fetch placements in the enrollment process via an Apex method `getPlacementsInEnrollmentProcess`. It processes and formats the fetched data for display in a datatable.

```js
@wire(getPlacementsInEnrollmentProcess, {contactId : null})
```

### handleManageButtonClick
Triggered by clicking the 'Manage' button. It sets the selected placement to the row selected in the datatable and transitions the UI to manage enrollments for the selected placement.

### handleBackClick
Sets the component UI back to the state where the user can select a placement from the list.

### handleAddClick
Opens a modal form for adding a new enrollment to the selected stage.

### closeModal
Closes the modal form without saving changes.

### handleFormSuccess
Refreshes the placements result to reflect the changes made in the modal form.

### updateHandler
Updates the current stage of an enrollment record using the `updateRecord` method from LDS.

### showToast
Displays a toast message indicating the success of an operation.

## Properties

- `columns`: Configuration for the columns in the datatable.
- `title`: Title text displayed on the component.
- `headerText`: Header text giving instructions to the user.
- `placementsResult`, `placements`, `selectedPlacement`, `selectedEnrollments`: Variables holding data related to placements and enrollments.
- `contactId`, `accountId`: Store the contact ID and account ID related to the current user.
- `containerStyle`, `sectionHeadingStyle`: CSS styles applied dynamically based on account settings.
- `showModal`, `isEnrollment`: Boolean flags controlling UI state.
- `pickVals`, `statusPickVals`: Hold the picklist values for the enrollment stages and status fields.

## Use Case

This component is useful in scenarios where there's a need to manage enrollments for various assignments within an organization. It streamlines the process of selecting placements, viewing/enrolling candidates, and updating enrollment stages, thereby facilitating efficient management of enrollment processes.

## Important Notes

1. **Custom Apex Methods**: The component relies heavily on custom Apex methods for data retrieval and operations. Ensure these Apex methods are deployed and have the appropriate access permissions set.
2. **Datatable Selection**: The logic within `handleManageButtonClick` and `handleBackClick` assumes single-row selection from the datatable. Modifications may be required for multi-row selection support.
3. **Styling**: CSS variables and dynamic styles are used. Make sure to define these CSS variables (`--black`, `--background-color`) globally if they are not part of your Salesforce org's default theme.
4. **RecordTypeId Hardcoding**: The `recordTypeId` in `getPicklistValuesByRecordType` wire service is hardcoded. Consider dynamically fetching or parameterizing this value based on your org's requirement.
5. **Security**: Always ensure that user permissions and sharing settings are properly configured, especially when performing DML operations or accessing sensitive data.
