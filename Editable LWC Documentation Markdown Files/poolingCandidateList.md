### Description

The `PoolingCandidateList` component is designed for Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) framework. It displays a list of candidate pools related to a specific account and provides the capability to create new candidate pools. It features dynamic styling, infinite scrolling for data tables, and conditional rendering based on the component's state.

### Methods

- **handleEnableContactCreation**: This method toggles the flag `enableContactPollsCreation` to show or hide the form for creating new contact polls.
  
- **connectedCallback**: Lifecycle hook which fires when the component is inserted into the DOM. It initializes component data by fetching the associated account ID, updating styles based on account information, and loading initial candidate pool data.

- **renderedCallback**: Lifecycle hook which fires after every render of the component. It ensures the initial loading of more data into the data table.

- **loadMoreData**: This method is invoked to load more data into the data table as the user scrolls, implementing an infinite scrolling functionality.

### Properties

- **testAccountId (@api)**: An API property that allows you to set an Account ID for testing purposes.
  
- **title (@api)**: An API property to set the title displayed on the component.

- **error**: To store error messages from server-side calls.

- **columns**: Defines the columns for the `lightning-datatable`.

- **candidatData**: An array to store the data fetched for the candidate pools.

- **recordCount**: Keeps track of the number of records displayed in the datatable.

- **initialized**: A flag to ensure certain actions are only performed once after the component is rendered.

- **wiresLoaded (@track)**: A tracked property to manage the rendering flow based on whether the asynchronous operations have completed.

- **loadMoreStatus**: Indicates the current status of loading more data into the datatable (e.g., "Loading" or "No more data to load").

- **totalNumberOfRows**: Stores the total number of candidate pool records available.

- **enableContactPollsCreation**: A boolean flag to show or hide the form for creating new candidate pools based on user interaction.

### Use Case

This component is ideal for Salesforce Communities or Lightning Applications where managing and creating account-related candidate pools is required. It can be used on account detail pages or as part of a recruitment module within a Salesforce application to streamline the process of managing candidate pools.

### Important Notes

- Before deploying this component, make sure the Apex classes (`nuService_Contact` and `nuService_nuJobOrder`) and their respective methods (`fetchContactIdFromUser`, `fetchAccountByContactId`, `fetchAccountCandidatePool`, `countAccountCandidatePool`) are available and properly configured in your Salesforce org. These classes are responsible for fetching necessary data from Salesforce.

- The component makes use of the `@salesforce/community/basePath` module to construct URLs for candidate pool details. Ensure that your Salesforce community is correctly configured for this component to function as expected.

- Dynamic styling based on account information (e.g., `Tertiary_Color__c`, `Secondary_Color__c`) suggests the component is designed to adapt visually depending on specific account settings. Ensure these fields are available and populated on the Account object in your org.

- The functionality to load more data as the user scrolls (infinite scrolling) requires proper indexing and performance tuning on the Salesforce side to ensure a smooth user experience, especially for large datasets.

- Custom CSS is imported from 'c/nuCSS', and utility methods from 'c/nuUtils'. Ensure these resources exist and are accessible in your Salesforce org.
