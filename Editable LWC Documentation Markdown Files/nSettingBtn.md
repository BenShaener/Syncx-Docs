### Important Notes

- Make sure to import necessary Salesforce modules like `LightningElement`, `lightning-icon`, etc., for this component to function properly.
- The component utilizes a CSS file that includes both component-specific styles and an import statement for shared CSS, ensuring consistent styling across the application with the use of variables.
- Mobile responsiveness is considered in the CSS design, making the settings dropdown adapt to different screen sizes.
- The Lightning Web Components (LWC) framework handles reactivity efficiently, updating the UI in response to user inputs and selections without manual DOM manipulations.
- Ensure the property and method names used in the JavaScript class match those referenced in the template to maintain the component's functionality.
