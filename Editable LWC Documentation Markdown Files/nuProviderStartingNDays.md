### Description

The `NuProviderStartingNDays` component is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component designed to display a table of candidates starting assignments within a certain number of days (either within 7 or 10 days, based on the `cmpVariant` attribute). It dynamically fetches this data using Apex controller methods to retrieve the relevant candidate and assignment information based on the current user's contact and account information. The component also supports themed styling based on account properties or default styles.

### Properties

- `cmpVariant`: Used to specify the variant of the component. Determines whether the component is fetching data for candidates starting in 7 days or 10 days. It is an API property so it can be set externally.

- `title`: The title of the component, automatically set based on the `cmpVariant`.

- `recordCount`: The count of records (placements) retrieved and displayed in the datatable.

- `accountId`, `agencyId`, `contactId`: Track properties that store IDs necessary for data retrieval.

- `placements`: Stores the data to be displayed in the datatable.

- `sectionHeadingStyle`, `containerStyle`: Dynamic styling for the component elements based on account data or default styles.

- `columns`: Configurations for the columns in the `lightning-datatable`. 

### Methods

- **connectedCallback:** Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is inserted into the DOM. It sets the component's title based on the `cmpVariant`.

- **renderedCallback:** Lifecycle hook that runs after every render of the component. It is used to add an additional column to the datatable based on whether the account is recognized as an agency.

- **populateContactId, populateAccountData:** Wired methods to fetch contact ID and account data respectively. Account data is used to fetch placements and determine styles.

- **handleResult:** Processes the fetched placements and prepares them for display in the datatable.

### Use Case

This component is ideal for use in a Salesforce Community or any Salesforce App where there's a need to display recently starting candidates within a specified timeframe (7 or 10 days) related to the logged-in user's account. It's particularly useful for agencies or organizations that need to track placements and candidate assignments efficiently.

### Important Notes

- Custom Apex methods (`fetchContactId`, `fetchAccountByContactId`, `fetchPlacementsWhereProviderStartingSevenDays`, `fetchPlacementsWhereProviderStartingTenDays`) are required for the component to function correctly. Their implementations should be ensured in the Apex class `nuService_Contact`.

- The component makes use of dynamic styling based on account properties. The `Use_Portal_Theme__c`, `Tertiary_Color__c`, `Secondary_Color__c`, `Primary_Text_Color__c`, and `RecordType.DeveloperName` fields on the account are particularly significant.

- The component's appearance and columns may change dynamically based on whether the account is recognized as an "Agency" and based on the component variant chosen (7 days or 10 days).

- The `lightning-datatable` is used to display the data with a custom column configuration defined in the component's JavaScript.

- This component leans on the utility class `nuUtils` for default page styles, ensuring that even in the absence of specific account-based styling, the component remains visually consistent with the application.
