### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed for the purpose of managing and approving timesheets and expenses. It dynamically renders tabs for timesheets and expenses depending on the availability of records. The component pulls data such as the user's contact ID, associated account information, and counts of records needing approval. It also adjusts its styling based on the associated account's preferences or falls back to a set of default styles. The component makes use of Apex controllers to fetch necessary data and utilizes conditional rendering within the template to enhance user experience.

### Methods

#### connectedCallback()
Executes when the component is inserted into the DOM. This lifecycle hook initiates the process of fetching the current user's contact ID, their associated account information, and checks for the existence of timesheet and expense records. It conditionally sets the styling of the component based on account preferences.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. Checks if a `testContactId` is provided; if so, it uses this for testing purposes, otherwise, it fetches the actual contact ID.
  2. Fetches associated account information using the contact ID.
  3. Sets styling based on account preferences or defaults.
  4. Checks for the existence of timesheet and expense records and updates component state accordingly.
  5. Fetches counts of timesheets and expenses needing approval.

### Properties

- **@track wiresLoaded**: Indicates if the necessary data has been loaded.
- **@api testContactId**: Optionally provided contact ID for testing purposes.
- **timesheetsExist**: Boolean indicating if timesheet records exist for approval.
- **expensesExist**: Boolean indicating if expense records exist for approval.
- **title**: Static title used in the page header.
- **countTimesheet**: String displaying the count of timesheets needing approval.
- **countExpense**: String displaying the count of expenses needing approval.

### Use Case

This component can be used in an approvals dashboard where managers or approvers need to review and approve timesheets and expenses submitted by employees or team members. It provides a clear indicator of the pending approvals and organizes them into tabs for efficient processing.

### Important Notes

1. **Styling**:
   The component's styling dynamically changes based on the associated account's preferences. If certain style-related fields (`Use_Portal_Theme__c`, `Tertiary_Color__c`, `Secondary_Color__c`, `Primary_Text_Color__c`) are set, the component uses these values. Otherwise, it uses default styles provided by `getPageStyles` from `nuUtils`.

2. **Data Fetching**:
   The component heavily relies on Apex controllers to fetch necessary data. Apex methods used include:
   - `fetchContactId`
   - `fetchAccountByContactId`
   - `fetchRecordsExist`
   - `fetchAllCounts`
   
   Proper error handling and loading indicators are implemented to enhance user experience.

3. **Conditional Rendering**:
   The use of `<template if:true={...}>` and `<template if:false={...}>` directives facilitates conditional rendering based on the state of data (e.g., `wiresLoaded`, `timesheetsExist`, `expensesExist`).

4. **Testability**:
   Through the use of the `@api testContactId` property, the component allows for ease of testing by manually setting a contact ID, bypassing the need to fetch it dynamically.
