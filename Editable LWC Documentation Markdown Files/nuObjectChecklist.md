### Description

This Salesforce Lightning component, named `NuObjectChecklist`, is designed to display a setup checklist for a particular record. The checklist items are fetched from a Salesforce Apex controller and displayed in a series of `lightning-card` components. Each item shows its completion status indicated by an icon, its name, and optionally a "Go To" button linked to a URL, along with a list of values beneath it if present.

### Methods

#### `wiredChecklist`
This method is triggered by the `@wire` service, invoking the `returnChecklist` Apex method with the current `recordId`. It processes the returned data, displaying it within the component. In case of any error, it logs the error to the console.

#### `handleGoToClick`
Handles click events on the "Go To" buttons. It uses the `NavigationMixin.GenerateUrl` to generate a standard URL based on the `data-id` attribute of the clicked button, which it then opens in a new window.

### Properties

- **@api recordId**: This is an externally accessible property used to pass the record ID into the component, determining which checklist items to fetch and display.
- **checklistList**: An array that stores the checklist items fetched from the Apex controller for display.

### Use Case

This component is used to provide users with a visual checklist related to a specific Salesforce record. Each checklist item indicates whether the task is complete, provides a name for the task, and optionally includes a direct link to another page and a list of related values. This is useful in guiding users through setup processes or ensuring that all necessary tasks related to a record are completed.

### Important Notes

1. **CSS Styling**: Custom CSS styles are applied to list items and headers. Ensure these styles meet your org's design guidelines.
2. **Deep Copy Utility**: The component uses a `deepCopy` method from a custom utility module `nuUtils`. This method must be provided within your org to ensure the component functions correctly.
3. **Error Logging**: The component logs errors to the console but does not provide user-facing error messages. Consider enhancing error handling for a better user experience.
4. **Data Fetching**: The checklist data is fetched using an Apex controller named `nuChecklistController` and its method `returnChecklist`. Ensure this controller and method exist and are properly configured in your org.
5. **Standard Web Page Navigation**: When opening URLs, the component assumes that they can be navigated to as standard web pages. Ensure the URLs provided in checklist items are accessible to users and consider modifying navigation handling for different types of URLs if needed.

### Example Implementation

```javascript
import { api, LightningElement, wire } from 'lwc';
import returnChecklist from '@salesforce/apex/nuChecklistController.returnChecklist';

export default class ExampleComponent extends LightningElement {
    @api recordId;

    // Define additional methods and properties as needed
}
```

This component serves as a dynamic, user-friendly way to display task completion and link users to necessary resources or additional actions within the Salesforce UI.
