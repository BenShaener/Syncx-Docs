### Description

The given Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to represent a custom listbox that supports both single and multiple selections. This component makes use of Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes for styling and is dynamically populated with items passed through `options` property. It features a scrollable container where list items are rendered. Each item can be interactively selected, with the selection logic accommodating both single and multi-selection modes through mouse click interactions. An event named `optionchange` is dispatched whenever the selection changes, carrying the latest selection data.

### Properties

- **`label`** (_@api_): The `aria-label` for the listbox used for accessibility.
- **`isMultiSelect`** (_@api_): A Boolean property to define if multiple items can be selected. Defaults to `false`.
- **`options`** (_@api_): An array of objects where each object represents an option in the listbox. Each object should have `label` and `value` properties.
- **`selectedOptions`** (_@api_): An array to track the selected options. It's updated based on user interactions.

### Methods

- **`get listOptions`**: A getter method that processes the `options` and `selectedOptions` to generate a new array (`mutatedOptions`) that is used to render the listbox. It marks options as selected based on `selectedOptions` and applies a CSS class for styling selected options.
- **`handleOptionClick`**: An event handler for click events on listbox options. It updates the selection based on user interactions and `isMultiSelect` property. It also dispatches an `optionchange` event with the updated selection.

### Use Case

The component can be used in Salesforce Lightning applications where a custom listbox is needed. For example, in a settings panel where users can select one or more options from a list, or in forms where users need to make a selection. The component's support for single and multiple selections makes it versatile for various use cases.

### Important Notes

- The component is styled using SLDS classes and custom CSS for specific styling.
- Accessibility considerations such as `aria-label`, `aria-multiselectable`, and `aria-selected` are implemented.
- The component relies on the parent component to pass `options` and listens for selection changes through the `optionchange` event.
- To use this component, ensure the `options` and `selectedOptions` properties are correctly initialized and updated based on the application's logic.
- Proper handling of the `optionchange` event is necessary to update the parent component's state or to perform other actions based on the selection.

### Example Implementation

Here's a quick example of how you might initialize this component in a parent component's HTML file:

```html
<c-listbox label="Select Options"
           is-multi-select="true"
           options={myOptions}
           selected-options={mySelectedOptions}
           onoptionchange={handleOptionChange}>
</c-listbox>
```

And in the parent component's JavaScript file:

```javascript
import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc';

export default class ParentComponent extends LightningElement {
    @track myOptions = [
        { label: 'Option 1', value: '1' },
        { label: 'Option 2', value: '2' }
        // Add more options as needed
    ];

    @track mySelectedOptions = [];

    handleOptionChange(event) {
        this.mySelectedOptions = event.detail;
    }
}
```

This component is an excellent example of leveraging the LWC framework to create reusable UI elements that augment the Salesforce Lightning Experience with custom functionality.
