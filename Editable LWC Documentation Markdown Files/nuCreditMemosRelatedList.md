### Description

The Lightning Component `NuCreditMemosRelatedList` is designed to display a list of credit memos related to an invoice within a Salesforce environment using Lightning Web Components (LWC). It utilizes the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling and the `lightning-datatable` component for displaying the list of credit memos in a tabular format.

### Methods

- `handlePageRef(result)`: Used to handle the current page reference and generate a base URL for navigating to individual credit memo records.
- `handleResult(result)`: Invoked by the `@wire` service to handle the result of fetching related credit memos. It processes data to add additional properties required for displaying in the datatable and handles potential errors.

### Properties

- `invoiceId`: An `@api` decorated property that takes an external Invoice ID as input to fetch related credit memos.
- `columns`: Contains the configuration for the columns of the `lightning-datatable`.
- `creditMemos`: An `@track` decorated property that stores the processed list of credit memos to be displayed in the datatable.

### Use Case

This component can be used in a Salesforce org to visually represent a list of credit memos associated with a particular invoice. It enhances the user experience by providing a clear, tabular view of critical information regarding each credit memo, including a clickable link that takes the user directly to the detailed view of a credit memo, the worklog associated with it, and its amount. This component is ideal for financial or sales applications where tracking financial transactions and associated details is crucial.

### Important Notes

- The component expects the `invoiceId` to be provided externally, potentially as a page attribute or dynamically via another component, to retrieve and display the related credit memos.
- The backend Apex controller method `getInvoiceRelatedCreditMemos` must be implemented properly to return the necessary data fields (`creditMemoId`, `creditMemoName`, `worklogName`, and `amount`) for each credit memo related to the given invoice ID.
- It uses the Lightning Navigation service to generate URLs dynamically for navigating to the credit memo records, which means the format of the URL needs to be consistent with Salesforce's URL structure for records.
- The component is styled using SLDS and custom CSS to ensure consistency with Salesforce's design system, making it visually integrate well within the Salesforce UI.

```javascript
@wire(getInvoiceRelatedCreditMemos, {invoiceId : '$invoiceId'})
handleResult(result) {
    const {error, data} = result;
    if (data) {
        this.creditMemos = data.map(cm => {
            return {...cm, Id : cm.creditMemoId, nameUrl: this.currentUrl + cm.creditMemoId}
        })
    }
    if (error) {
        console.error('nuCreditMemoRelatedList error ::: ', JSON.stringify(error));
    }
}
```

The snippet above shows how the component dynamically handles the fetched credit memos data and potential errors, preparing the data for display in the `lightning-datatable`.
