### Description

The Salesforce Lightning component `NuPageLayout` is a complex, navigation-oriented component designed to provide modern, responsive navigation menus for Salesforce Lightning Experience or Communities. It dynamically displays various navigation tiles such as Job Orders, Applicant Tracking, Providers, and Agencies, each with a potential submenu for notifications. The component utilizes various API properties to fetch and display relevant data and incorporates styling for both desktop and mobile views. It implements programmatic navigation using the `NavigationMixin` for navigating to Salesforce pages or external URLs based on user interactions.

### Methods

#### 1. `navigateToHome`
Navigates the user to the Salesforce Home page.
```javascript
navigateToHome() {
    this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
        type: 'standard__namedPage',
        attributes: {
            name: 'Home'
        },
    });
}
```

#### 2. `navigateToPage`
Handles navigation to different pages based on the target's `data-navinfo` attribute. Utilizes the `navigationInformation` object for mapping navigation data.
```javascript
navigateToPage(e) {
    // Implementation of navigation based on 'data-navinfo' attribute
}
```

#### 3. `handleGotoUrl`
Directs the user to a URL when a notification is clicked after marking it as read on the server-side.
```javascript
handleGotoUrl(event) {
    // Handles redirection to specified URL after processing the notification
}
```

#### 4. `handleMobileNav`
Toggles the mobile navigation view on and off.
```javascript
handleMobileNav() {
    this.appClicked = !this.appClicked;
}
```

### Properties

#### 1. `testContactId` (API)
An API property to receive the contact ID for testing purposes.

#### 2. `jobOrderTiles`, `applicantTrackingtiles`, `providersTiles`, `agenciesTiles` (API)
API properties that hold arrays of objects representing different tiles for navigation such as Job Orders, Applicant Tracking, etc.

#### 3. `isDataComplete` (Track)
A tracked property to control the rendering of the component's template when data fetching is complete.

#### 4. `headingStyle`, `linkContainerStyle`, `linkStyle`, `notificationDropdownStyle`, `submenuStyle` 
These properties contain styles applied to various parts of the component.

#### 5. `brandingStyle`, `linkContainerClass`, `closeClass`
Computed properties used for dynamic styling and class assignment based on component state.

### Use Case

This component is designed for use within Salesforce Lightning Experience or Communities where a dynamic, responsive navigation bar is required. It could be particularly useful for a custom home page or a navigation side panel where users need access to different Salesforce entities or external resources, with additional context provided by notifications.

### Important Notes

1. **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Data for tiles like Job Orders and Applicant Tracking is intended to be dynamically fetched and passed via API properties. Ensure the data structure matches what is expected in the component.

2. **Navigation Data Setup**: The component includes a `navigationInformation` object to map user clicks to Salesforce navigation events. This object must be tailored to include valid Salesforce named pages, object pages, filters, etc.

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mobile navigation is handled through a combination of CSS and JavaScript. Ensure the CSS media queries and JavaScript methods (`handleMobileNav`) align with your layout requirements.

4. **Action Handling**: The component includes handlers for both navigating to Salesforce pages and external URLs (`handleGotoUrl`). Ensure that actions such as `updateReadOn` correctly interface with backend logic for marking notifications as read.

5. **Style Customization**: Component styling is defined within the CSS file. Modify these styles to match the desired look and feel, paying attention to both desktop and mobile versions.
