### Description

The `OrdersList` component is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed to display a list of "Release Tiers" related to a specific Account in a data table format. It dynamically fetches and displays data, including the capability to incrementally load more data as the user scrolls, leveraging Salesforce's `lightning-datatable` component. The component's appearance is customized based on specific Account settings or global themes.

### Methods

#### connectedCallback()

The `connectedCallback` lifecycle hook is used to perform initial data fetching operations. This includes retrieving the Contact ID associated with the current user, fetching Account details based on this Contact ID, and then loading the initial batch of "Release Tiers" data and the total number of rows available. It conditions styling based on Account-specific settings or global themes.

```JS
connectedCallback() {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

#### renderedCallback()

The `renderedCallback` lifecycle hook is used to initiate the loading of more data once the component has rendered. This is particularly useful for initially populating the data table.

```JS
renderedCallback() {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

#### loadMoreData(event)

This method is triggered when more data needs to be loaded into the data table. It specifically handles the infinite loading capability by fetching the next batch of "Release Tiers" records and updating the UI accordingly.

```JS
loadMoreData(event) {
    // Implementation details...
}
```

### Properties

- `@api testAccountId`: Externally set Account ID used for testing purposes.
- `@api title`: The title to be displayed above the data table.
- `@track accountId`: Stores the Account ID determined either from `testAccountId` or fetched based on the user's Contact ID.
- `@track wiresLoaded`: Boolean indicating whether the initial data loading operations have completed.
- `columns`: Defines the columns to be displayed in the data table.
- `releaseTiers`: An array that stores the fetched "Release Tiers" records to be displayed.
- `recordCount`: Keeps track of the number of records currently displayed to the user.
- `totalNumberOfRows=0`: Stores the total number of "Release Tier" rows that are available.
- `loadMoreStatus`: Indicates the current status of data loading operations, e.g., "No more data to load".

### Use Case

The `OrdersList` component is intended for use in scenarios where there is a need to display a list of "Release Tiers" associated with an Account in a paginated, easily navigable format within a Salesforce Community or Lightning Experience. It's suitable for handling large datasets by loading additional records on-demand as the user scrolls through the data table.

### Important Notes

- The component's styling and behavior are dynamically adjusted based on Account-specific settings or global themes, providing a customizable user experience.
- Data fetching is performed using Apex controller methods, making efficient use of server-side resources and reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.
- The component makes use of Salesforce's `lightning-datatable` for displaying data, leveraging its built-in functionality such as infinite loading and column sorting.
- Error handling is not explicitly detailed in the provided code excerpts, but it's important to robustly handle potential exceptions in both the Apex methods and the LWC to ensure a smooth user experience.
