### Description

This is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed for managing the compliance credentials of candidates through various stages in a placement process. The component allows users to view a list of placements, manage credentials for each placement, drag and drop credentials through different stages, and add new compliance credentials. It includes a modal form for specifying additional credential details. This component is built to be used within the Salesforce Lightning Experience and leverages the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling.

### Use Case

This component is intended for use in scenarios where an organization needs to track and manage the compliance credentialing process of candidates through various stages. It allows users to interact with a visual representation of the credentialing process, move credentials through stages, and specify additional details when necessary. It's especially useful in healthcare staffing or similar fields where compliance to specific qualifications or credentials is critical.

### Important Notes

- This component assumes that related Apex controllers (`nuService_Contact`, `nuController_CredentialsChecklist`, etc.) are implemented and available in the Salesforce org.
- Lightning Data Service (LDS) and Lightning UI API are heavily utilized for CRUD operations and record data retrieval.
- Usage of the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) ensures the component aligns with Salesforce's design guidelines.
- Proper error handling should be implemented (some console error logging is included, but UI feedback for errors may be expanded).
- Security features such as checking user permissions and field-level security considerations should be reviewed and implemented as necessary.
