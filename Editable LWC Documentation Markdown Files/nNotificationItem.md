### Description

This Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NNotificationItem` is designed to display individual notification items, which are part of a larger notification framework presumably. This component uses the Lightning Navigation Service to redirect users when they interact with a notification. It utilizes conditional styling to visually distinguish between read and unread notifications.

### Methods

- **handleGotoUrl**

This method is responsible for navigating the user to a specific Salesforce record or named page based on the `notificationItem` property. Unread notifications are also presumably marked as read (code commented out), and the `notificationId` is stored in the localStorage for later use.

- **ntfItemTitleClass**

A getter that returns a CSS class based on whether the `notificationItem` has been read. It returns `'ntf-item-title-bold'` for unread notifications to make the title bold, and `'ntf-item-title'` for read notifications.

### Properties

- **notificationItem** (exposed via `@api`)

This property is meant to hold the data of an individual notification item. It must be passed into the component from its parent.

### Use Case

This component is used within a broader notification system in a Salesforce application. When included in a page, it visualizes notification items and allows users to interact with them. On click, it navigates the user to the related Salesforce record or a named page, making it an integral component for user engagement and action on received notifications.

### HTML Structure

The component's template is straightforward, consisting of a `div` that binds the `handleGotoUrl` method to its `onclick` event. It displays the notification's title, reference text, and body. The title's CSS class changes based on whether the notification has been read or not, providing visual feedback to the user.

```html
<template>
    <div onclick={handleGotoUrl} class="ntf-drop-item">
        <div class={ntfItemTitleClass}>{notificationItem.title}</div>
        <div>{notificationItem.referenceText}</div>
        <div>{notificationItem.body}</div>
    </div>
</template>
```

### CSS

The component comes with styles that define basic font sizing, padding, margins, and hover effects to enhance user experience. Additionally, it imports shared styles with `@import 'c/nSharedCss';`.

```css
.ntf-drop-item {
    font-size: 14px;
    padding: 5px;
    margin: 5px 5px 10px 5px;
    transition: all 100ms;
    cursor: pointer;
    border-bottom: 1px solid var(--grey-light-1);
}

.ntf-drop-item:hover {
    background-color: var(--primary-color-light-2);
}

.ntf-item-title {
    font-size: 16px;
}

.ntf-item-title-bold {
    font-size: 17px;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Important Notes

1. **NavigationMixin**: The component extends `NavigationMixin` to use the Navigation Service in Lightning Web Components efficiently, making it capable of navigating to Salesforce record pages or named pages dynamically.

2. **Read Marking Logic**: The logic for marking notifications as read (commented out in the JS code) indicates an intended feature to change the state of a notification upon the user's action. This functionality should be properly implemented and tested to ensure correct behavior.

3. **Local Storage Use**: Storing the `notificationId` in the localStorage is a notable method for passing values between components/pages. However, it's essential to consider security and potential limitations of localStorage in complex applications.
