### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to display details of a timesheet record in Salesforce, highlighting various attributes such as position, week starting, week ending, total hours, guaranteed hours, work location, expense status, and reasons for rejection if any. It also provides capability to navigate to further details or actions related to the timesheet, like uploading or viewing expenses and initiating a chat regarding the timesheet record.

### Methods

#### `handleUrlClick(event)`

Handles the click event on the timesheet URL to fire a custom event named `timesheeturlclick` with the `timesheetId` as detail.

```javascript
fireCustomEvent(this, 'timesheeturlclick', { timesheetId: this.timesheet.timesheetId });
```

#### `handleAttachmentsClick(event)`

Invoked when the button to view or upload expenses is clicked. It checks whether to view or upload based on the button's label and fires a custom event `fileattachmentsclick` with `timesheetId` and `viewOnly` status.

```javascript
const view = this.expensesLabelButton == 'View Expenses' ? true : false; 
fireCustomEvent(this, 'fileattachmentsclick', { timesheetId: this.timesheet.timesheetId, viewOnly: view });
```

#### `navigateToWorkRecord(event)`

Navigates to the work record related to the timesheet using Salesforce's standard record navigation functionality, focusing on the chat tab if applicable.

```javascript
this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({ 
    type:'standard__recordPage',
    attributes:{ 
        recordId: recordId,
        actionName: 'view',
    },
    state: {
        focusOnChatTab: true 
    }
});
```

### Properties

- `timesheet`: An object holding the details of a timesheet record.
- `timesheetLabel`, `positionLabel`, `weekStartLabel`, `weekEndLabel`, `totalHoursLabel`, `guaranteedHoursLabel`, `RejectedReasonLabel`, `workLocationLabel`, `expenseStatus`: String properties to hold labels for timesheet-related data.
- `showPosition`, `showWorkLocation`, `showWeekStart`, `showWeekEnd`, `showTotalHours`, `showGuaranteedHours`, `showFiles`: Boolean properties controlling the visibility of respective fields in the UI.
- Various getter methods like `TimesheetLabel`, `rejected`, `expenseButtonExceptRejected`, `showExpenseStatus`,  provide computed values for use within the component.

### Use Case

The component is ideal for use in a project management or HR system where tracking timesheet details, including hours worked, expenses incurred, and reviewing specific timesheet records are vital aspects. It allows users to get a quick overview of timesheet status and perform actions like uploading expense details directly from the summary view.

### Important Notes

- Requires `import` statements for specific Salesforce modules like `LightningElement`, `NavigationMixin`, and Apex methods (`fetchTimesheet`, `fetchContact`), indicating that this component is tightly coupled with Salesforce's ecosystem.
- This component utilizes Salesforce's Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling, ensuring consistency with the Salesforce UI.
- It's essential to have `c/nuUtils` and `c/nuCSS` utility components or modules available in your org for this component to function correctly, as it relies on them for utility functions and CSS variables.
- The component makes asynchronous calls to fetch timesheet data when the `timesheetId` is defined. Proper error handling is implemented to manage any errors that occur during these asynchronous operations.

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the functions, methods, and use cases of the `NuTimesheetHeaderView` Lightning Web Component.
