### Description

The component, `NuCalendar`, is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) designed to offer a rich interactive calendar interface. It is built using the FullCalendar library along with Salesforce Apex for data handling. The component allows users to view and manage shift-related events stored in Salesforce, including but not limited to shifting availability, confirmed shifts, and open shift claims. It supports various views such as month, week, and day views, along with a list view for a complete overview of scheduled events. Features include navigating through dates, adding new shifts, selecting and viewing event details, and interacting with the calendar using clicks and selections.

The calendar provides functionalities like browsing through shifts by week, day, or month, adding new availability, and viewing detailed information about specific shifts including participant details and status.

### Important Notes

- The component requires external libraries such as FullCalendar and Font Awesome to be loaded for full functionality.
- Salesforce Apex controllers are used for data operations, such as fetching events (`getEventsNearbyDynamic`) and saving event details (`saveEvent`, `saveEventClaim`).
- The component is designed to be versatile, supporting multiple views and interaction patterns tailored to scheduling and shift management use cases.
- Styling relies on SLDS classes, which should be consistently applied for a unified look and feel within Salesforce Lightning Experience.
