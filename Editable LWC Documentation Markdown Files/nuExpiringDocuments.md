### Description

The `NuExpiringDocuments` Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to provide users with a view of expiring documents related to specific candidates within Salesforce. This component displays a list of candidates with details such as their credentials, specialties, and the number of expiring documents. Users can expand a candidate's row to view detailed information about each expiring document, including the credential name, specialty, expiration date, document type, and status. Additionally, users can update a credential directly from within the component using a file upload functionality.

### Methods

1. **handleContactResult**
   - Description: Wired method to fetch the contact ID from the user's record and subsequently load related account and expiring document information.
   - Parameters: contactResult (object) containing the contact data.

2. **doExpandCredentials**
   - Description: Toggles the visibility of the expanded view that shows details of expiring documents for a specific candidate.
   - Parameters: event (Event) used to retrieve the document ID (`docId`) from the clicked row.

3. **doViewCred**
   - Description: Handles the navigation to view a specific credential file by fetching the credential's URL and using the NavigationMixin to navigate.
   - Parameters: event (Event) used to retrieve the credential ID from the selected document.

4. **handleFileUploaded**

4. **showSpinner**
   - Description: Controls the visibility of a loading spinner to indicate when data is being fetched or an operation is being performed.

### Use Case

This component can be useful in situations where a healthcare staffing agency uses Salesforce to track the credentialing of their staff. As credentials such as licenses and certifications have expiration dates that need to be monitored and updated, this component provides a user-friendly interface to view and manage these expiring documents. Users can quickly see which documents are expiring, expand to view more details about them, and even update the documents directly from the component.

### Important Notes

- The component makes use of Apex methods to perform CRUD operations. Ensure that the Apex classes have the necessary permissions and are exposed to the LWC.

- Error handling for Apex methods is critical. While placeholder code for error logging exists, it's important to implement robust error handling to enhance user experience.

- The file size limit for credential uploads is hardcoded to 3MB. Consider validating this on the server side as well to ensure security and reliability.

- Styling is imported from a custom CSS module (`nuCSS`) and applied dynamically based on the account's theme preferences. Ensure that these styles are properly set up and tested.

- Since this component involves file handling (uploading), ensure that Salesforce file size limits and security considerations are followed.
