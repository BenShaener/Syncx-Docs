### Use Case

This component is particularly useful in scenarios where a manager or an approver needs to review timesheets submitted by employees. It allows for a detailed review process, enabling filtering by specific criteria (e.g., dates, candidate, location) and provides direct actions for approving or rejecting timesheets. The component enhances the efficiency of the timesheet approval process within organizations using Salesforce.

### Important Notes

- Component relies on Apex controller methods `approveTimesheet`, `rejectTimesheet`, and `fetchTimesheetsForApprover` for backend operations.
  
- `@wire` and `@track` decorators are used extensively for reactive properties and to wire Apex methods to component properties.
  
- Component utility functions `fireToast`, `deepCopy`, and `logIt` from `c/nuUtils` are utilized for common operations.
  
- Component is designed with responsiveness in mind, although specific CSS class `slds-modal__container` is overridden to adjust modal width.
  
- Interaction with this component requires the user to have corresponding permissions to view and manage timesheets in the Salesforce org.
