### Description

The Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuWorkRecordsAndExpenses` is designed to manage and display various tabs related to work records and expenses. It displays different aspects of timesheets and expenses, segmenting timesheets into categories like Action Required, Submitted, and Approved, while also offering a view for managing expenses. The component makes use of child components to present detailed views and functionalities for each tab, showcasing a structured and organized approach to handling work records and expenses within a Salesforce organization.

### Methods

1. **connectedCallback**: This lifecycle hook is used for performing operations after the component gets inserted into the DOM. It initializes variables like `startDate`, `endDate`, `defaultTab`, and `childTab`, while leveraging `localStorage` to remember user's tab preferences.

### Properties

- **@api Properties**
  - **testContactId**: Id of the contact to test the component with, if necessary.
  - **renderMode, positionLabel, weekStartLabel, weekEndLabel, totalHoursLabel, guaranteedHoursLabel**: Configurable labels and modes for rendering timesheet information.
  - **fileAttachmentsPageName**: Specifies the page name for navigating to file attachments.
  - **title**: Title of the timesheets section.
  - **statusFilter, showFiles, showNote, showShift, showPosition, showWeekStart, showWeekEnd, clockInClockOut, showUnpaidBreak, showTotalHours, showGuaranteedHours, showWorkLocation**: Boolean flags and filters for controlling what elements to display on the UI.
  - **workLocationLabel, autoBreakValue, mode**: Additional configurations regarding work location label, automatic break value calculation, and component mode.
  - **unsubmittedTimesheets**: Array to keep track of unsubmitted timesheets.
  
- **@track Properties**
  - **contactId**: Stores the contact ID resolved for the current user.
  - **defaultTab, childTab**: Dynamically managed properties to control active tab based on user interaction or saved states.
  
### Use Case

This component could be used in a Salesforce application where managing and monitoring employee timesheets and expenses is crucial. It allows employees to navigate through their work records categorically, submit their timesheets, and manage expense records, all in one place. HR personnel or managers could use this component to overview and approve timesheets or to review expense submissions efficiently.

### Important Notes

1. **Lightning Data Service (LDS) and Apex**: The component utilizes LDS and Apex calls to fetch relevant data, such as the contact ID associated with the current user and timesheets for the employee. It's important to handle these calls with care to ensure data security and performance.
   
2. **Front-End Handling**: It heavily relies on front-end logic to dynamically switch between tabs and manage the state of the displayed content. This approach necessitates careful state management and UI responsiveness concerns.
   
3. **Accessibility and Internationalization**: While the code presents basic functionalities, attention should be given to enhancing accessibility features and internationalization, ensuring the component can be used effectively by a global audience across different locales.

4. **Caching and Performance Optimization**: The component makes use of `localStorage` to remember user preferences for tabs. Developers should consider caching strategies and performance optimization, especially when dealing with large sets of timesheet data or complex user interactions.

5. **Security Considerations**: Ensure that the component adheres to Salesforce's security best practices, especially in relation to exposing sensitive employee data like timesheets and expenses. Use of field-level security, object-level security, and sharing rules should be meticulously planned.

```javascript
// Key snippet illustrating usage of @wire service to fetch data based on dynamic properties
@wire(fetchTimesheetsForEmployee,{ contactId: '$contactId', statusFilters: '$unsubfilters', startDate: '$startDate', endDate: '$endDate' })
wiredTimesheets(wireResult) { /* ... */ }
```

This component exemplifies a complex integration of Salesforce LWC with Apex backed services for handling real-world HR and employee management workflows within Salesforce.
