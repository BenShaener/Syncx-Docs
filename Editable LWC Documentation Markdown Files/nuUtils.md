### Description

This Salesforce Lightning component is designed to interface with various Apex controllers and utilities for fetching and processing large amounts of related information from Salesforce. It is primarily focused on dashboard functionality, allowing users to interact with job orders, notifications, contacts, accounts, and more. The code dynamically generates dashboard tiles, and integrates style settings based on preferences or defaults. 

### Methods

1. **fireCustomEvent, fireCustomLocalEvent, fireToast:** These methods are used to dispatch custom events within the Salesforce platform. `fireCustomEvent` and `fireCustomLocalEvent` allow bubbling to vary, while `fireToast` is specifically for showing toast messages with customizable titles, messages, and variants.

    ```javascript
    fireCustomEvent(component, customEventName, eventValue)
    fireCustomLocalEvent(component, customEventName, eventValue)
    fireToast(component, title, message, type)
    ```

2. **parseBool, isStringMissing, isMobile, getUrlParameter:** Utility methods for parsing boolean values from various types, checking if a string is missing, detecting if the device is mobile, and fetching URL parameters respectively.

    ```javascript
    parseBool(value)
    isStringMissing(val)
    isMobile()
    getUrlParameter(name)
    ```

3. **round, logIt, debugIt, elapsedSeconds, deepCopy, getEventStyle, formatPhoneNumber, fetchContactAndRelatedData, getPageStyles, getISODate, getMidnightISO, getLocalISO, getWeekDay, buildDashboard:** These methods serve various purposes ranging from rounding numbers, logging, deep copying objects, formatting phone numbers, fetching related data for contacts, getting page styles, formatting dates, and building the dynamic dashboard based on settings.

    ```javascript
    round(value, decimals)
    logIt(name, obj)
    debugIt(target, debugVar)
    elapsedSeconds(startTime)
    deepCopy(inObject)
    getEventStyle(eventType)
    formatPhoneNumber(phone)
    fetchContactAndRelatedData()
    getPageStyles(accountRecordType)
    ```

### Properties

- **API_NAMES:** This is an external reference to constants that map API field names, used throughout the component to access specific fields dynamically.

### Use Case

This component is designed to be used in a customized Salesforce Lightning dashboard. It fetches and displays information related to job orders, contacts, accounts, and other entities based on the logged-in user's roles and permissions. The component also personalizes the dashboard with styling settings and dynamically generated content including notifications and actionable items.

### Important Notes

- The component relies heavily on promises and asynchronous Apex calls to fetch data, which means it handles a considerable amount of information and may need to be adjusted based on the specific Salesforce org's limits and performance considerations.
- Style customization is supported, and component behavior changes based on the account's RecordType and other settings. This dynamic nature should be thoroughly tested to ensure all users see the correct data and style.
- The large number of imported Apex methods indicates that the backend logic is complex, and any changes to these methods should be carefully coordinated with updates to this component.
