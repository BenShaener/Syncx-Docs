### Description

This Lightning Web Component (LWC) named `NuQuickActionCancelByClient` provides functionality to cancel a hiring audit by displaying a modal dialog where a user can submit reasons for the cancellation. It leverages the Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) for styling a modal layout that includes a form for capturing cancellation details. The component uses Salesforce's `lightning-record-edit-form` to interact with the Hiring Audit record, displaying pre-filled statuses and requiring a reason for the cancellation. Additionally, it supports dynamic data fetching with `@wire` service to retrieve related record data and utilizes the Salesforce UI API for record updates.

### Methods

- **doSubmit()**: Submits the form data captured in the `lightning-record-edit-form`. It also triggers a spinner to indicate the processing state until a response is received.

- **successHandler(event)**: Handles the successful submission of the form. It updates the status of a related Placement record and dispatches a custom event to signal the completion of the quick action.

- **errorHandler(event)**: Logs errors encountered during form submission to the console.

- **closeQuickAction()**: Dismisses the modal and stops the spinner. It also dispatches a custom event signaling the user has closed the action without completing it.

### Properties

- **hiringAuditId**: (Decorated with `@api`) Represents the record ID of the Hiring Audit that is being cancelled.

- **placementId**: (Decorated with `@api`) The ID of the Placement related to the Hiring Audit.

- **hiringAuditObject, statusField, stageField, reasonField**: These properties hold the schema descriptors for the Hiring Audit object and its fields to be used in the component.

- **showSpinner**: Boolean flag used to control the visibility of the spinner indicating processing state.

- **statusValue, stageValue**: Pre-defined values to be displayed for the status and stage fields, indicating that the Hiring Audit has been canceled by the client.

### Use Case

This component can be utilized in a Salesforce org where tracking and management of hiring audits are required, and there is a need for a quick and seamless process to cancel these audits. It's particularly useful in scenarios where an audit needs to be marked as cancelled and a reason for the cancellation needs to be captured, all while updating related records based on this action.

### Important Notes

- The component is designed to be used within contexts where a `placementId` is available, from which it retrieves and sets the `hiringAuditId`.
- The `.css` code related to the styling of this component is not provided but is assumed to utilize standard SLDS classes for modals.
- The component's functionality relies on the Salesforce schema names being correctly provided and existing in the org where it's deployed.
- Error handling in this component is minimal and primarily logs the errors to the console. Depending on the use case, more sophisticated error handling and user feedback mechanisms should be considered.
- Custom events like `finishquickaction` are dispatched to signal completion states but require corresponding event handlers in the parent component or application for further action.
