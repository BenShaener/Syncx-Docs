This Lightning Web Component (LWC) is designed to display a navigable tile representing either a Salesforce object or a specific page with rich visual cues including a customizable icon, optional notifications, and dynamic navigation based on the tile's configuration. It efficiently handles user interactions to navigate to desired targets within the Salesforce system. Below is the documentation for the component separated into sections.

### Description

The `NSquareTile` component is a versatile, navigable tile that can represent different entities within Salesforce, such as a Salesforce object list view or a named page. It comes with customization options, including an icon with color variations, a label, and the ability to display notifications. The component makes use of conditional rendering to adjust its functionality and appearance based on the provided properties.

### Methods

1. `navigateToObjectListView()`:
   Invokes the standard Salesforce object page navigation with specific filter criteria.
   ```javascript
   this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
       type: "standard__objectPage",
       attributes: {
           objectApiName: this.tileData.objectApiName,
           actionName: "list"
       },
       state: {
           filterName: this.tileData.filterName,
           [this.tileData.filterIdPropertyName]: this.tileData.filterIdValue
       }
   });
   ```

2. `navigateToPage()`:
   Navigates to a named Salesforce community page based on the `pageName` attribute.
   ```javascript
   this[NavigationMixin.Navigate]({
       type: 'comm__namedPage',
       attributes: {
           pageName: this.tileData.pageName
       }   
   }, false);
   ```

### Properties

1. `tileData` (@api):
   An object containing configuration details for the tile, including `pageName`, `objectApiName`, `filterName`, `iconName`, `iconColor`, `label`, and `value`.

2. `notificationArr` (@api):
   An array of notifications to be displayed on the tile. If populated, it triggers the display of notification indicators.

3. `showNotifications`:
   A boolean indicating whether the notification indicator should be shown. Automatically set based on the presence and length of `notificationArr`.

4. `compClass` (getter):
   Dynamically determines the CSS class to be applied to the component's icon based on the `iconColor` attribute of `tileData`.

### Use Case

The `NSquareTile` component is ideal for dashboard implementations within Salesforce Lightning Experience or Salesforce Communities where a visual, navigable interface is needed to represent and access objects or specific pages quickly. It enhances user experience by providing immediate visual cues and simplifying the navigation process.

### Important Notes

- Ensure that the `tileData` property is correctly populated to define the tile's behavior and appearance. Misconfiguration may lead to unexpected behavior.
- The `notificationArr` property must be an array. Even if notifications are not required, this property should be defined, at least as an empty array, to avoid console errors.
- The component makes extensive use of Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes for styling but introduces some custom styling that may need adjustments based on the context of usage.
- The component is dependent on the `lightning/navigation` module for navigating to the target pages or object lists, ensuring seamless integration within the Salesforce ecosystem.

The `NSquareTile` LWC provides a flexible, visually appealing way to represent and access various entities within Salesforce, enhancing navigation and user experience.
